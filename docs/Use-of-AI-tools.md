### AI Tool Usage Documentation

The use of ChatGPT or comparable AI tools was permitted and integrated into this project for various tasks. Below, the specific areas where AI tools were utilized are documented, along with an assessment of their contributions and the prompting strategies employed.

**Tasks and Prompting Strategies**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Task: Creating a bar chart to analyze the distribution of articles per domain and interpreting the results.
    - Prompting Strategy: Providing structured prompts such as "Create a bar chart to show the number of articles per domain and write a comment explaining the key insights."
    - Outcome: Enabled quick visualization and analysis of data, ensuring clarity in identifying dominant domains and their contributions to the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    - Task: Suggestions for handling outliers, normalizing data, and implementing text chunking strategies.
    - Prompting Strategy: Queries included examples of data and questions like "How to handle outliers in content length?"
    - Outcome: Delivered practical solutions that aligned well with the dataset requirements.
3. Skill Development:
    - Task: Using AI tools to learn new techniques or refine existing skills, such as summarization or tokenization.
    - Prompting Strategy: Explorative queries like "Explain tokenization and its impact on embeddings."
    - Outcome: Provided comprehensive explanations that enhanced understanding of specific topics.

**Most Effective Prompting Strategy**

The most successful prompting strategy was specific and structured queries. For instance:
- Solving the Task: Prompts like "Generate a box plot to identify outliers in character count with appropriate labeling" directly solved the task at hand with minimal iterations.
- Skill Acquisition: Explorative prompts, such as "Explain the relationship between content length and sentiment score in the dataset," contributed significantly to building domain knowledge.

**Discussion and Assessment**

The use of ChatGPT and similar tools significantly improved productivity and efficiency throughout the project. The tools provided tailored solutions for technical tasks, while their ability to offer explanations also facilitated learning. However, critical review and refinement of AI-generated outputs were necessary to ensure accuracy and relevance to the project. Overall, these tools proved invaluable for bridging technical challenges, streamlining workflows, and enhancing documentation quality, while also contributing to skill development in data science workflows.
