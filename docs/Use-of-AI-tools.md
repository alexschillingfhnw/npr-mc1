### AI Tool Usage Documentation
The use of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot was permitted and integrated into this project for various tasks. Below, the specific areas where these tools were utilized are documented, along with an assessment of their contributions and the prompting strategies employed.

#### **Tasks and Prompting Strategies**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - **Task:** Creating a bar chart to analyze the distribution of articles per domain and interpreting the results.
   - **Prompting Strategy:** Providing structured prompts such as "Create a bar chart to show the number of articles per domain and write a comment explaining the key insights."
   - **Outcome:** Enabled quick visualization and analysis of data, ensuring clarity in identifying dominant domains and their contributions to the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - **Task:** Suggestions for handling outliers, normalizing data, and implementing text chunking strategies.
   - **Prompting Strategy:** Queries included examples of data and questions like "How to handle outliers in content length?"
   - **Outcome:** Delivered practical solutions that aligned well with the dataset requirements.

3. **Skill Development:**
   - **Task:** Learning new techniques, such as using APIs for summarization and integrating tokenization pipelines.
   - **Prompting Strategy:** Explorative queries like "Explain how tokenization affects embeddings in retrieval models" to understand key concepts.
   - **Outcome:** ChatGPT provided in-depth explanations, while GitHub Copilot suggested implementation patterns in real time.

#### **Most Effective Prompting Strategy**

The most successful prompting strategy was specific and structured queries:
- **Solving the Task:** Prompts like "Generate a box plot to identify outliers in character count with appropriate labeling" directly solved the task with minimal iterations.
- **Skill Acquisition:** Explorative prompts, such as "Explain the relationship between content length and sentiment score in the dataset," enhanced domain knowledge and understanding.

#### **Discussion and Assessment**

The combination of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot significantly improved productivity and efficiency throughout the project. ChatGPT provided tailored solutions for technical tasks, in-depth explanations for concepts, and optimized suggestions for existing code. GitHub Copilot complemented this by accelerating code implementation and providing inline suggestions during development. While these tools proved invaluable for streamlining workflows and enhancing documentation, critical review and refinement of their outputs were necessary to ensure accuracy and alignment with project goals. Overall, the tools contributed meaningfully to bridging technical challenges, improving analysis workflows and fostering skill development in data science and software engineering.
