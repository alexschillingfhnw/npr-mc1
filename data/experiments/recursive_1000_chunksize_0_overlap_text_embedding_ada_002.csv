What is the innovation behind Leclanché's new method to produce lithium-ion batteries?,Leclanché's innovation is using a water-based process instead of highly toxic organic solvents to produce nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminium cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.,"Leclanché has developed an innovative, environmentally friendly method to produce lithium-ion batteries. The key innovation lies in replacing highly toxic organic solvents, which are commonly used in the production process, with a water-based process to make nickel manganese cobalt aluminium cathodes (NMCA). Organic solvents, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), are harmful to the environment and have been restricted by the European Commission due to their potential serious irreversible effects on human health and the environment. The water-based process is not only technically simpler but also eliminates the risk of explosion, making the production process safer for employees. Additionally, it has a lower carbon footprint as it uses 30% less energy, which would otherwise be needed to","['The new battery leverages highly conductive biomimetic condensed state electrolytes to improve the conductive performance of the cells and in turn the efficiency of lithium ion transport, while also boosting the stability of the microstructure. The condensed matter battery is said to integrate a range of innovative technologies, including the ultra high energy density cathode materials, innovative anode materials, separators, and manufacturing processes, offering excellent charge and discharge performance as well as good safety performance, CATL said. However, no information has been revealed about the cost of the new cells, or the materials required to make them. A few other specifications, such as charging efficiency, charge/discharge rate, safety ranges, and life cycles, were also missing. The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the worlds electric vehicle batteries and 434% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh, has made groundbreaking', ""'Energy storage company Leclanch (SWLECN) has designed a new battery cell that uses less cobalt and boosts energy density by 20%. The company says it is also produced in an environmentally friendly way, making it more recyclable or easy to dispose of at end of life. Leclanch said it has developed an environmentally friendly way to produce lithium ion (Li ion) batteries. It has replaced highly toxic organic solvents, commonly used in the production process, with a water based process to make nickel manganese cobalt aluminium cathodes (NMCA). Organic solvents, such as N methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), are highly toxic and harmful to the environment. The use of NMP has been restricted by the European Commission, having been added to the list of Substances of Very High Concern, which can have serious irreversible effects on human health and the environment. Besides being technically simpler, eliminating the use of organic solvents also eliminates the risk of explosion, making the production"", 'process safer for employees. Leclanch claims to be a global pioneer in the field, having used aqueous binders in its for over a decade. A further benefit of the water based process is a lower carbon footprint, as it uses 30% less energy, which would otherwise be needed to dry, or evaporate, and recycle the solvents. With the water based production of the high capacity NMCA cathodes, we have reached a decisive milestone in lithium ion technology, said Dr Hilmi Buqa, vice president R & D at Leclanch. Until now, producing them using environmentally friendly processes was considered impossible. But, now we have mastered the process. In developing its new G/NMCA battery, Leclanch has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90%, which has the effect of increasing the energy density. The Grefers to the graphite anode. Increasing the nickel content allows for the cobalt content to be reduced from 20% to 5%. Compared to conventional G/NMC cells, these high capacity NMCA cathodes', 'lithium and cobalt based battery technologies', ""generating. Some experts project that the global demand for lithium ion batteries may increase tenfold or more in the next decade. Given such projections, many researchers are looking for ways to improve the lithium ion battery technology. Deng and her group aren't materials scientists, so they don't focus on making new and better battery chemistries. Instead, their goal is to find a way to lower the high cost of making all of those batteries. And much of the cost of making a lithium ion battery can be traced to the manufacture of materials used to make one of its two electrodes the cathode. The MIT researchers began their search for cost savings by considering the methods now used to produce cathode materials. The raw materials are typically salts of several metals, including lithium, which provides ions the electrically charged particles that move when the battery is charged and discharged.

When did the cooperation between GM and Honda on fuel cell vehicles start?,July 2013,The cooperation between GM and Honda on fuel cell vehicles started in July of 2013.,"['collaboration launched in July of 2013, providing for the two companies to share the combined total of 1,200 fuel cell patents they compiled in the years leading up to 2012. GM introduced its SURUS fuel cell electric vehicle platform in 2017, but it still didnt have a fuel cell EV in commercial production by 2020, though a preliminary agreement with Nikola Motor involving the Badger fuel cell electric pickup truck suggested that activity was about to pick up. Unfortunately for FCEV fans, Nikola fell on its face following a scandal involving former CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola has since recovered itself, but the relationship with GM foundered. GM has not been idling around since then. As part of its collaboration with Honda, GM set its sights on developing fuel cells for heavy duty use, resulting in its Hydrotec suite of fuel cell systems. In 2021 GM launched a hydrogen powered flight collaboration with Hydrotec and the aerospace company Liebnerr. GM is also collaborating with Navistar on', 'to demonstrate a fleet of 16 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which were modified versions of the Chevy Equinox crossover SUV. If you think car when you spot an SUV, then GM put a fleet of 16 fuel cell cars on the road. The next year, GM and Honda announced a fuel cell collaboration. Honda also signed on to an Obama era program to build a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure, and in 2017 the two companies announced their intention to build a fuel cell factory in Ohio. In 2018, GM reaffirmed its commitment to include fuel cell vehicles in its lineup by 2020, but the year came and went with no fuel cell electric car in sight. However, GM was still moving forward behind the scenes, including a new venture in the field of fuel cell aircraft. Last fall GM also came roaring back into the fuel cell fold with a focus on green hydrogen for its fuel cells. Coincidentally or not, last fall Honda reaffirmed its plans to produce an all electric version of its popular CR V crossover SUV with a', 'battery pack and a fuel cell range extender (here is additional coverage). That was certainly not a coincidence. Though Honda snared much of the media spotlight with its CR V announcement, last week the company issued a press release that underscored its collaboration with GM. Since 2013, Honda has been working with GM on the joint development of the next generation fuel cell system, Honda explained, confirming that it plans to launch a new fuel cell electric car in 2024, equipped with the next generation fuel cell system jointly developed with GM. This next generation fuel cell system, which leverages the knowledge, know how and economies of scale of both companies, will reduce the cost to one third compared to the cost of the fuel cell system in the 2019 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell, Honda stated. If you caught that thing about the Clarity, thats significant because the Clarity was an electric sedan, not an SUV. Honda introduced the car in 2017, but discontinued it within just a few', 'years, including an all battery version as well as fuel cell and hybrid versions. Clearly the end of Clarity did not mean giving up the fuel cell dream. The collaboration with GM paid off on the cost cutting side, bringing fuel cell electric cars closer to parity with battery electric and gas powered cars. Honda listed innovative materials for electrodes, an enhanced cell sealing structure, streamlined supporting equipment, and productivity improvements among the elements leading to reduced costs. Honda also stated that it has further cost cutting strategies in hand. The company foresees another 50% reduction in costs in the coming years, on top of the 33% reduction achieved with GM. In an interesting twist, Honda seemed to indicate that its fuel cell collaboration with GM is coming to a close, at least in its present form. Honda has begun fundamental research on future fuel cell technologies with targets to halve the cost and double the durability compared to the fuel cell system co', 'developed with GM, the company stated. That language suggests Honda is branching off to develop its own technology, if not dropping the relationship entirely. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, GM may have something up its sleeve as well. In 2016 the company delivered a mission ready fuel cell version of its Colorado pickup truck to the US Army for testing. In a 2018 recap of the program, the Army noted that it has leveraged more than $ 3 billion in GM research and development spent on fuel cell technologies over the last several decades. That collaboration includes the 2006 Project Driveway test of 100 fuel cell electric cars in the form of Chevys Equinox. Dont be surprised if you see a fuel cell version of the Equinox on the horizon, though a consumer ready fuel cell edition of the Colorado pickup truck is another possibility.

Erratic and milder winters can disrupt these patterns, making it difficult for growers to mitigate large scale swings in temperature.

Certainly in the US and Canada there is increasing focus on recycling. Jason Smith, sustainable supply and value Chain expert at PA Consulting, says theyre looking at individual component parts and processes, probably 10% of the market moving forward that can be reused. The challenge is that the PV supply chain is quite complex, involving silicon, copper, glass, and other materials. Recovery is labor', 'One of the main reasons why people are fixing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in large numbers is to help the environment, but the industry is now struggling with the waste produced by 100,000 tons of panels due to be disassembled in Australia beginning in 2035. A recent study conducted at the University of South Australia has put forth a comprehensive product stewardship scheme for solar panels, which the Federal Government favored several years ago. According to UniSA researcher Professor Peter Majewski, incentives are required for producers to construct solar panels that can be more easily recycled if they are destroyed or out of warranty. The research was published in the journal AIMS Energy. Australia has one of the highest uptakes of solar panels in the world, which is outstanding, but little thought has been given to the significant volume of panels ending up in landfill 20 years down the track when they need to be replaced.

Why does melting ice contribute to global warming?,"Melting ice contributes to global warming because white ice reflects the sun's rays, while the dark sea absorbs over ten times more solar energy, increasing heat and accelerating warming.","Melting ice contributes to global warming through a process known as the albedo effect. Ice, being white, reflects a large portion of the sun's rays back into space, which helps to keep the Earth cool. However, when ice melts, it reveals the darker surfaces beneath, such as the sea or land. These darker surfaces absorb more of the sun's heat, rather than reflecting it, which leads to an increase in temperature. This can create a feedback loop, where the increased temperature causes more ice to melt, revealing more dark surface, absorbing more heat, and so on. Additionally, the melting of ice, particularly in the Arctic, can lead to the release of trapped greenhouse gases, which can further contribute to global warming.","[""tinges it black. There is a reason why the black algae so interesting for the researchers. When the ice darkens, it becomes more difficult to reflect sunlight. Instead, heat from the sun's rays is absorbed by the ice, which starts to melt. The more the ice melts, the warmer the temperature on Earth. The algae therefore play an important role in global warming, says Alexandre Anesio. In recent years, larger and larger areas of the ice have become stained by the algae, making the ice melt even faster. Alexandre Anesio has calculated that the algae are increasing the ice melt by about 20 per cent. The algae on the ice also existed before people kicked off global warming through industrialisation. However, climate change means spring arrives ever earlier to the Arctic and as a result the algae have a longer season to grow and spread. The algae spread a little more every year. When I travel to Greenland, I now see vast areas where the ice is completely dark because of the algae, he says."", ""present in the area. When the sea ice in the Lincoln Sea starts to melt during the summer months, it can have severe climate consequences. Whereas white ice reflects the sun's rays, a dark sea absorbs over ten times as much solar energy, contributing to global warming. Furthermore, it can have an impact on ecosystems The sea ice is a base for many ecosystems. The algae we examined are food for fish, fish are food for birds, etc. How will the marine ecosystems be affected globally if the sea ice disappears? We don't know the answer yet. According to the Aarhus University investigators, the research can be perceived as good and bad news for the climate. The bad news is that we can see this happening very soon. The good news is that our data shows the trend is reversible and we can do something about it if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and set ambitious political goals. If we can keep temperatures stable or perhaps even make them fall, the sea ice would return to the area. Christof"", 'Utilizing artificial intelligence, scientists from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and the University of Copenhagen discovered that meltwater in tunnels beneath Greenlands ice sheet changes speed and, in some places, accelerates rapidly towards the ocean. This can boost melting, particularly in a warming climate, which is why the studys researchers believe it is important to monitor. Greenlands ice sheet is massive, accounting for nearly half of all fresh water in the northern hemisphere. However, rising global temperatures are causing it to melt and the worlds oceans to rise. As a result, the movement of the ice sheet is closely monitored. Scientists from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) and the University of Copenhagens Niels Bohr Institute carried out a study that shows how ice sheet movements appear to be closely associated with meltwater flow beneath the ice. The investigators used artificial intelligence to evaluate ice movements, which they', 'that simulate the dynamics of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica often do not account for the fact that ice sheet melting will affect ocean processes, which, in turn, can feed back onto the ice sheet and the atmosphere. Jun Young Park is also a student at the Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea. The group of climate researchers discovered that an ice sheet/sea level runaway effect can be avoided only if the world achieves net zero carbon emissions before 2060, using a new computer model that incorporates for the first time the coupling between icebergs, ice sheets, ocean, and atmosphere. If we miss this emission goal, the ice sheets will disintegrate and melt at an accelerated pace, according to our calculations. If we dont take any action, retreating ice sheets would continue to increase sea level by at least 100 cm within the next 130 years. This would be on top of other contributions, such as the thermal expansion of ocean water. Ice sheets react to atmospheric', ""emissions from northern permafrost soils by 50 100 percent and could lead to a large scale collapse of boreal permafrost. Huge chunks of the massive West Antarctic ice sheet's foundation depend on submarine continental bedrock. This topography makes it possible for specific flow dynamics to collapse the West Antarctic ice sheet. When the ice melts below a specific threshold, instability occurs because of rising ocean temperatures. The onset of self perpetuating feedback results in an acceleration of ice loss. The tipping point is projected to be a 15 C global temperature rise. If the ice sheet melts, it will raise the global sea level by approximately three meters. Atlantic warm water influx amplifies the loss of Barents Sea ice. The tipping point or an abrupt loss will reach 16 C. Loss of sea ice in the Barents Sea will considerably affect atmospheric circulation, European climate, and possibly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

Why is cannabis cultivation moving indoors?,"to meet the demand for higher-quality products, control environmental factors and flowering periods, and ensure consistent, year-round harvests","Cannabis cultivation is moving indoors due to several reasons. Firstly, indoor cultivation allows for control over environmental factors and preferable wavelength, which can lead to the production of premium products. This is particularly important in a competitive market where consumers can easily access a large black market. Secondly, large scale outdoor farming is fraught with risk, such as environmental impacts like wildfires that can spoil the harvest. The single harvest from outdoor farming is only attractive for consumers for several months, and if the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other months of the year, they'll turn to indoor or greenhouse-grown cannabis. Lastly, indoor cultivation allows for consistent, year-round harvests, which is not possible with outdoor farming.","['easily access a black market at least double the size of the regulated (and taxable) industry, commercial cannabis companies are incentivized to produce premium products only cultivable in a climate controlled environment. Large scale outdoor farming is also fraught with risk. In October, or Croptober as it is known, all of Californias outdoor grown cannabis is harvested. This single harvest, if it has not been spoiled by environmental impacts such as wildfires, is only attractive for consumers for several months. If the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other nine months of the year, well, theyll turn to an indoor site or greenhouse. Despite the alarming energy intensity of indoor cultivation, the sheer roofspace of grow houses is an ideal solar platform. California based Canndescent boasts more than 100,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and annually produces almost 17 tons of cannabis. In 2019, Canndescent installed a 2825 kW solar system at its facility', 'flowering periods. More importantly, it means consistent, year round harvests. However, the high powered lights and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a Sasquatch sized carbon footprint. A 2022 report from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. UNODC estimated that the carbon footprint is 16 times to 100 times larger than for outdoor cultivation. Indoor factory farming is incompatible with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards, says Evan Mills, principal at engineering consultancy Energy Associates and a former senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mills spelled out the problem in a paper published in Energy Policy in 2012, the year Colorado and Washington state legalized cannabis and spurred a domino effect elsewhere. Even then, he', ""estimated indoor cultivation accounted for 1% of total US electricity use, for a carbon footprint equivalent to three million cars. The scientist estimated 42% of cultivators grew exclusively indoors by 2020, often in multiple sprawling, Walmart scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately, installing large scale solar on site isnt an easy solution. According to Mills' recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe, California, the amount of solar needed to achieve net zero energy supply would cover 1,400 acres far more land than would be necessary if the cannabis were grown outdoors. While entirely valid, Mills' research suggests an erroneous equivalency between indoor and outdoor grown cannabis.

They presented their findings in Spectral engineering of ultra thin germanium solar cells for combined photovoltaic and photosynthesis, which was recently published in Optics Express.

With the high absorption coefficient of our films, an ultra thin layer of AgBiS2 NCs would be sufficient to absorb most of the light in the visible range, they stated. The researchers engineered the layer of nanocrystals in the cell with an unconventional approach described as cation disorder engineering, through which they tuned the atomic positions of the cations within the lattice of AgBiS2 nanocrystals to trigger a cation inter site exchange and achieve a homogenous cation distribution. Mercaptopropionic acid was used as a passivating ligand to preserve the material quality upon annealing. Our theoretical', 'The PV problem is twofold.
