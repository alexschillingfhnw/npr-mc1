Why does melting ice contribute to global warming?,"Melting ice contributes to global warming because white ice reflects the sun's rays, while the dark sea absorbs over ten times more solar energy, increasing heat and accelerating warming.","Melting ice contributes to global warming through a process known as the albedo effect. Ice, being white, reflects a significant portion of the sun's rays back into space, which helps to keep the Earth cool. However, when ice melts, it reveals the darker surfaces beneath, such as the sea or land. These darker surfaces absorb more of the sun's rays, converting them into heat and causing the Earth to warm up. This in turn leads to more ice melting, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates global warming. Additionally, certain types of algae that grow on ice can increase the rate of ice melt, further contributing to global warming.","['the warmer the temperature on Earth. The algae therefore play an important role in global warming, says Alexandre Anesio. In recent years, larger and larger areas of the ice have become stained by the algae, making the ice melt even faster. Alexandre Anesio has calculated that the algae are increasing the ice melt by about 20 per cent. The algae on the ice also existed before people kicked off global warming through industrialisation. However, climate change means spring arrives ever earlier to', 'it gets lost to melting/calving, she said. This was also likely the cause of larger ice loss during warmer periods of the past.
