What is the innovation behind Leclanché's new method to produce lithium-ion batteries?,Leclanché's innovation is using a water-based process instead of highly toxic organic solvents to produce nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminium cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.,Leclanché has developed a new method to produce lithium-ion batteries in an environmentally friendly way.,"[""'Energy storage company Leclanch (SWLECN) has designed a new battery cell that uses less cobalt and boosts energy density by 20%. The company says it is also produced in an environmentally friendly way, making it more recyclable or easy to dispose of at end of life. Leclanch said it has developed an environmentally friendly way to produce lithium ion (Li ion) batteries. It has replaced highly toxic organic solvents, commonly used in the production process, with a water based process to make nickel manganese cobalt aluminium cathodes (NMCA). Organic solvents, such as N methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), are highly toxic and harmful to the environment. The use of NMP has been restricted by the European Commission, having been added to the list of Substances of Very High Concern, which can have serious irreversible effects on human health and the environment. Besides being technically simpler, eliminating the use of organic solvents also eliminates the risk of explosion, making the production process safer for employees. Leclanch claims to be a global pioneer in the field, having used aqueous binders in its for over a decade. A further benefit of the water based process is a lower carbon footprint, as it uses 30% less energy, which would otherwise be needed to dry, or evaporate, and recycle the solvents. With the water based production of the high capacity NMCA cathodes, we have reached a decisive milestone in lithium ion technology, said Dr Hilmi Buqa, vice president R & D at Leclanch. Until now, producing them using environmentally friendly processes was considered impossible. But, now we have mastered the process. In developing its new G/NMCA battery, Leclanch has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90%, which has the effect of increasing the energy density. The Grefers to the graphite anode. Increasing the nickel content allows for the cobalt content to be reduced from 20% to 5%. Compared to conventional G/NMC cells, these high capacity NMCA cathodes also enable a 20% increase in the energy density of a typical Li ion battery. It also enables a longer service life, high cycle stability and good chargeability. The new cells are best suited for electric vehicles and heavy duty transport applications, such as ships, buses and trucks, due to their high volume energy density and high cycle stability. In December 2022, US based startup Group14 attracted $ 614 million in one of the largest climate tech fundraises in 2022. Its promise to address supply"", ""to produce next generation battery anodes from the bottom up by depositing vaporized lithium metal, which the Company plans to manufacture itself. Li Metal's technology and approach are designed to minimize the amount of lithium metal used compared to conventional processes, which improves safety, increases cost effectiveness and puts less pressure on the lithium resources further minimizing its environmental footprint. At Li Metal's advanced anode pilot plant in Rochester, New York, the Company has proven its ability to produce lithium metal anode products with lithium thickness between 3 and 25 micrometres. The process has also been shown to work effectively for the pre lithiation of silicon anodes. Currently, the Company operates the highest intensity PVD lithium metal anode process in the battery industry, is engaged with 27 automakers and battery developers, and is actively sampling anode materials with 12 leading next generation battery developers for product qualification"", ""'South Korean scientists have developed a new way to integrate a lithium metal anode into a battery and reach higher energy capacity levels than current lithium ion tech. They worked with a carbon fiber paper infused with lithium and demonstrated an energy density of 428 Wh/kg, along with encouraging performance in stability and potential ease of manufacturing. Image Lee et al, Advanced Energy Materials, CC by 40 Creative Commons License CC BY 40 The integration of lithium metal into lithium ion batteries, in order to replace the graphite commonly used today as an anode material, will be a major step forward in energy storage technology that could allow for a big jump in battery capacity and performance. But lithium metal is a difficult material to work with, and its tendency to form dendrite structures that branch out of the anode and cause short circuits has limited development. Researchers are pursuing various strategies to overcome the challenge posed by lithium metal, and a group led by Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology and Jeonbuk National University in South Korea has proposed an approach that appears to offer several advantages. The group has worked with carbon fiber paper as a replacement for the copper foil commonly used to form the lithium metal anode structure. The group prepared carbon fiber with polymer binders and used a 3D framework into which lithium metal was infused. The preparation is described in full in the paper Construction of Hierarchical Surface on Carbon Fiber Paper for Lithium Metal Batteries with Superior Stability, recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. Batteries developed using the carbon fiber/lithium metal anode achieved a high specific energy of 428 Wh/kg. Considering the five times lower density and lower cost of carbon fiber compared to copper, our proposed anode material is an important achievement that can accelerate the commercialization of durable and lightweight lithium metal batteries, said Sung Ho Lee, head of the Carbon Composite Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. The current issue of PV Magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells.

Reports come"", ""ion battery technology. Deng and her group aren't materials scientists, so they don't focus on making new and better battery chemistries. Instead, their goal is to find a way to lower the high cost of making all of those batteries. And much of the cost of making a lithium ion battery can be traced to the manufacture of materials used to make one of its two electrodes the cathode. The MIT researchers began their search for cost savings by considering the methods now used to produce cathode materials. The raw materials are typically salts of several metals, including lithium, which provides ions the electrically charged particles that move when the battery is charged and discharged. The processing technology aims to produce tiny particles, each one made up of a mixture of those ingredients, with the atoms arranged in the specific crystalline structure that will deliver the best performance in the finished battery. For the past several decades, companies have manufactured those cathode materials using a two stage process called coprecipitation. In the first stage, the metal salts excluding the lithium are dissolved in water and thoroughly mixed inside a chemical reactor. Chemicals are added to change the acidity (the pH) of the mixture, and particles made up of the combined salts precipitate out of the solution. The particles are then removed, dried, ground up, and put through a sieve. A change in pH won't cause lithium to precipitate, so it is added in the second stage. Solid lithium is ground together with the particles from the first stage until lithium atoms permeate the particles. The resulting material is then heated, or annealed, to ensure complete mixing and to achieve the targeted crystalline structure. Finally, the particles go through a deagglomerator that separates any particles that have joined together, and the cathode material emerges. Coprecipitation produces the needed materials, but the process is time consuming. The first stage takes about 10 hours, and the second stage requires about 13 hours of annealing at a relatively low temperature (750 degrees Celsius). In addition, to prevent cracking during annealing, the temperature is gradually ramped up and down, which takes another 11 hours. The process is thus not only time consuming but also energy intensive and costly. For the past two years, Deng and her group have been exploring better ways to make the cathode material. Combustion is very effective at oxidizing things, and the materials"", ""A discovery by MIT researchers could finally unlock the door to the design of a new kind of rechargeable lithium battery that is more lightweight, compact, and safe than current versions, and that has been pursued by labs around the world for years. The key to this potential leap in battery technology is replacing the liquid electrolyte that sits between the positive and negative electrodes with a much thinner, lighter layer of solid ceramic material, and replacing one of the electrodes with solid lithium metal. This would greatly reduce the overall size and weight of the battery and remove the safety risk associated with liquid electrolytes, which are flammable. But that quest has been beset with one big problem dendrites. Dendrites, whose name comes from the Latin for branches, are projections of metal that can build up on the lithium surface and penetrate into the solid electrolyte, eventually crossing from one electrode to the other and shorting out the battery cell. Researchers haven't been able to agree on what gives rise to these metal filaments, nor has there been much progress on how to prevent them and thus make lightweight solid state batteries a practical option. The new research, being published today in the journal Joule in a paper by MIT Professor Yet Ming Chiang, graduate student Cole Fincher, and five others at MIT and Brown University, seems to resolve the question of what causes dendrite formation. It also shows how dendrites can be prevented from crossing through the electrolyte. Chiang says in the group's earlier work, they made a surprising and unexpected finding, which was that the hard, solid electrolyte material used for a solid state battery can be penetrated by lithium, which is a very soft metal, during the process of charging and discharging the battery, as ions of lithium move between the two sides. This shuttling back and forth of ions causes the volume of the electrodes to change. That inevitably causes stresses in the solid electrolyte, which has to remain fully in contact with both of the electrodes that it is sandwiched between. To deposit this metal, there has to be an expansion of the volume because you're adding new mass, Chiang says. So, there's an increase in volume on the side of the cell where the lithium is being deposited. And if there are even microscopic flaws present, this will generate a pressure on those flaws that can cause cracking. Those stresses, the team has now shown, cause the cracks that allow""]",0.19107501615301048,0.09889071592348239,0.03777469392825537,0.02381848845488711,0.33333333333333337,0.15,0.33333333333333337,0.7913702196093612

Industrial policy focus on critical renewable energy supply chains is a good thing. However, were worried by the lack of focus in todays Communication, said Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. Not all net zero technologies are in the same boat not in terms of strategic importance, or even the impact theyre feeling from the Inflation Reduction Act. Ursula von der Leyen said during the presentation of the plan that Europe is determined to lead the clean technology revolution. She added that better access to financing will allow key industries of clean technologies to grow rapidly. Brussels has its sights set on the extraordinary Summit of EU Leaders on Feb 9 and Feb 10. The meeting is expected to address the community response to subsidies from the United States and from China, where announced investments in clean technologies will exceed $ 280 billion"", ""'The European Commission listed tax exemptions, flexible aid, and the promotion of local manufacturing among its key strategies for the Green Deal Industrial Plan. However, the SolarPower Europe industry group has criticized the plans lack of focus on solar. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presents the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The European Commission has published a new document on the Green Deal Industrial Plan that EC President Ursula von der Leyen announced at Davos in mid January. The European counterpart to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to create an environment that is conducive to increasing the European Union's manufacturing capacity of net zero technologies, to improve the competitiveness of European industry. The plan proposed this week has yet to be discussed among member states and will be presented at the European summit in March. It includes proposals to make state aid more flexible, mobilize European funds, create a sovereign wealth fund, and improve European supply chains. The state aid revisions would apply until 2025, in comparison with the IRAs 10 year time frame. The industrial plan will be based on four pillars a predictable and simplified regulatory environment, better access to finance, upskilling, and open trade for resilient supply chains. As part of the first pillar, the European Commission will propose an industry law to set targets for industrial capacity and provide an adequate regulatory framework for rapid deployment. It will guarantee faster, simplified permits, while also promoting strategic European projects. The framework will be complemented by the Critical Raw Materials Act and electricity market reforms. The second pillar of the plan will accelerate investment and financing to produce clean technologies in Europe. The European Commission said public funding could unlock huge amounts of private funding. It wants to relax the rules on state aid that will be applied through the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) for state aid. This will involve the expansion of provisions for net zero technologies and storage, while eliminating the need for open tenders for less mature technologies and extending deadlines to complete projects.

When did the cooperation between GM and Honda on fuel cell vehicles start?,July 2013,The cooperation between GM and Honda on fuel cell vehicles started in 2013.,"['on the road. The next year, GM and Honda announced a fuel cell collaboration. Honda also signed on to an Obama era program to build a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure, and in 2017 the two companies announced their intention to build a fuel cell factory in Ohio. In 2018, GM reaffirmed its commitment to include fuel cell vehicles in its lineup by 2020, but the year came and went with no fuel cell electric car in sight. However, GM was still moving forward behind the scenes, including a new venture in the field of fuel cell aircraft. Last fall GM also came roaring back into the fuel cell fold with a focus on green hydrogen for its fuel cells. Coincidentally or not, last fall Honda reaffirmed its plans to produce an all electric version of its popular CR V crossover SUV with a battery pack and a fuel cell range extender (here is additional coverage). That was certainly not a coincidence. Though Honda snared much of the media spotlight with its CR V announcement, last week the company issued a press release that underscored its collaboration with GM. Since 2013, Honda has been working with GM on the joint development of the next generation fuel cell system, Honda explained, confirming that it plans to launch a new fuel cell electric car in 2024, equipped with the next generation fuel cell system jointly developed with GM. This next generation fuel cell system, which leverages the knowledge, know how and economies of scale of both companies, will reduce the cost to one third compared to the cost of the fuel cell system in the 2019 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell, Honda stated. If you caught that thing about the Clarity, thats significant because the Clarity was an electric sedan, not an SUV. Honda introduced the car in 2017, but discontinued it within just a few years, including an all battery version as well as fuel cell and hybrid versions. Clearly the end of Clarity did not mean giving up the fuel cell dream. The collaboration with GM paid off on the cost cutting side, bringing fuel cell electric cars closer to parity with battery electric and gas powered cars. Honda listed innovative materials for electrodes, an enhanced cell sealing structure, streamlined supporting equipment, and productivity improvements among the elements leading to reduced costs. Honda also stated that it has further cost cutting strategies in hand. The company foresees another 50% reduction in costs in the coming years, on top of the 33% reduction achieved with GM. In an interesting', ""'Honda (and GM) to fuel cell electric car fans never give up, never surrender. While the debate between batteries and fuel cells rages on, some automakers have decided to settle the issue by producing an electric car that sports both a battery pack and a fuel cell stack. Honda belongs to that set, and it plans on adding green hydrogen punch to the picture, too. Does that even make sense? Well it might, and GM could be along for the ride, too. Fuel cell electric cars have been achingly slow to catch on in the US, but activity in the area has begun to tick up overseas. Fuel cells have also begun to attract attention from truck makers including Nikola, which is apparently back on track to launch fuel cell trucks in the US. Thats still quite a leap to fuel cell electric cars, but the crossover SUV area comes close, depending on how you define a car, and car makers are beginning to dip into the SUV field. Adding a twist to the activity is the idea pairing batteries and fuel cells in a single vehicle. Fuel cell vehicles already use batteries for some functions, so the idea is to increase the battery size to add range. That mashup has come across the CleanTechnica radar before, most recently when the UK startup Tevva decided to modify its plan for incorporating a diesel engine as a range extender on its hybrid electric trucks, much as the Chevy Volt deployed a battery that enabled drivers to cruise on more than 50 miles of electricity before their gas engine kicked in. The Volt eventually gave way to the all battery Bolt, and Tevva leveled up to to introduce an all battery truck last month. Tevva also plans to launch a 75 tonne battery powered truck with a hydrogen fuel cell range extender later this year. For the record, our friends over at Motor Trend note that Stellantis has also introduced a van that incorporates batteries. As for the Chevrolet brands parent company, General Motors, thats where things get interesting. Back in 2012, GM partnered with the US Army to demonstrate a fleet of 16 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which were modified versions of the Chevy Equinox crossover SUV. If you think car when you spot an SUV, then GM put a fleet of 16 fuel cell cars on the road. The next year, GM and Honda announced a fuel cell collaboration. Honda also signed on to an Obama era program to build a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure, and in 2017 the two companies announced their intention to build a fuel cell factory in Ohio. In 2018, GM reaffirmed its"", 'equipment, and productivity improvements among the elements leading to reduced costs. Honda also stated that it has further cost cutting strategies in hand. The company foresees another 50% reduction in costs in the coming years, on top of the 33% reduction achieved with GM. In an interesting twist, Honda seemed to indicate that its fuel cell collaboration with GM is coming to a close, at least in its present form. Honda has begun fundamental research on future fuel cell technologies with targets to halve the cost and double the durability compared to the fuel cell system co developed with GM, the company stated. That language suggests Honda is branching off to develop its own technology, if not dropping the relationship entirely. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, GM may have something up its sleeve as well. In 2016 the company delivered a mission ready fuel cell version of its Colorado pickup truck to the US Army for testing. In a 2018 recap of the program, the Army noted that it has leveraged more than $ 3 billion in GM research and development spent on fuel cell technologies over the last several decades. That collaboration includes the 2006 Project Driveway test of 100 fuel cell electric cars in the form of Chevys Equinox. Dont be surprised if you see a fuel cell version of the Equinox on the horizon, though a consumer ready fuel cell edition of the Colorado pickup truck is another possibility. GM is also working with the Defense Innovation Unit to analyze its advanced Ultium batteries for military use, so stay tuned for more on that. Follow me on Trainwreck Twitter @ TinaMCasey.

Honda believes these fuel cells will provide the foundation for a completely new generation of passenger vehicles, starting with a Honda CRV based fuel cell vehicle which will go into production at its factory in Ohio in the midwestern United States in 2o24. Building on its existing passenger vehicle fleet, Honda plans to use these fuel cells as the backbone for larger and more capable fuel cell power systems like the one installed in Torrance at its facilities around the world. A mock up of a CRV fuel cell that Honda expects to begin producing at its factory in Ohio, United States in 2024. Image credit Kyle Field, CleanTechnica Hondas plans laid out a clear path from the current technologies to deploying fuel cells across its vehicle fleet with a special focus on heavy vehicles (see image below). Heavy vehicle segments like commercial vehicles and construction vehicles are definitely the lower hanging fruit when it comes to fuel cells as hydrogen production and fueling stations can be developed and installed at the point of use. Public fueling infrastructure is still significantly lacking in density and reliability, even in Southern California, where several dozen stations have been installed. The size of the challenge and cost of developing zero emission hydrogen production, compression, distribution, and fueling where none exists can not be understated. Battery electric vehicles, on the other hand, can charge up anywhere with an outlet in a pinch. It is exciting to see the slow and steady progress Honda is making with hydrogen fuel cells, but it is hard seeing the new stationary power system installation in Torrance as anything more than a publicity stunt. It could be a path to the zero emission future eventually, but with the climate crisis causing significant, immediate challenges at the global scale each and every day, do we really have time to wait decades for Honda to deploy meaningful zero emission hydrogen solutions when they could be building and selling zero emission battery electric vehicles today?

As an activist investor, Kyle owns long term holdings in Tesla, Lightning eMotors, Arcimoto, and SolarEdge', ""'Green hydrogen is needed to ice the zero emission fuel cell electric cake for GMs Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure vehicle platform. General Motors has dropped hints about its interest in fuel cell electric vehicles over the years, but apparently that is just the tip of a much bigger iceberg. The company has made some interesting moves in recent months which suggest a more holistic approach to the green hydrogen economy of the future, regardless of what the skeptics may say. GMs interest in hydrogen caught the CleanTechnica eye back in 2013, after the company introduced a demonstration fleet of 16 fuel cell electric vehicles for the US Army in Hawaii. The Army demonstration was built on GMs Project Driveway fleet of 119 vehicles, which launched in 2007 and racked up almost 3 million miles of driving in six years. What caught our eye was a new hookup between GM and Honda. Honda was also hammering away at the challenge of introducing fuel cell vehicles to the US market. The collaboration launched in July of 2013, providing for the two companies to share the combined total of 1,200 fuel cell patents they compiled in the years leading up to 2012. GM introduced its SURUS fuel cell electric vehicle platform in 2017, but it still didnt have a fuel cell EV in commercial production by 2020, though a preliminary agreement with Nikola Motor involving the Badger fuel cell electric pickup truck suggested that activity was about to pick up. Unfortunately for FCEV fans, Nikola fell on its face following a scandal involving former CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola has since recovered itself, but the relationship with GM foundered. GM has not been idling around since then. As part of its collaboration with Honda, GM set its sights on developing fuel cells for heavy duty use, resulting in its Hydrotec suite of fuel cell systems. In 2021 GM launched a hydrogen powered flight collaboration with Hydrotec and the aerospace company Liebnerr. GM is also collaborating with Navistar on fuel cells for trucks, and with Wabtec on fuel cells for locomotives. GM has also been deploying Hydrotec modules as transportable charging stations for battery electric vehicles. The sticky wicket, of course, is the continued reliance on natural gas and other fossil resources to produce the hydrogen needed to run fuel cells. GM has a plan for that, too. Last November, GM enlisted Nel USA, a unit of Norways Nel ASA, to help push down the cost of electrolyzer systems and pump up the green""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13333333333333336,0.0,0.13333333333333336,0.26470083424880353
Did Colgate-Palmolive enter into PPA agreements with solar developers?,yes,"Yes, Colgate-Palmolive entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Scout Clean Energy, a Colorado-based solar developer.","[""'Colorado based solar developer Scout Clean Energy has signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with household product manufacturer Colgate Palmolive for the power due to be produced at its 209MW Markum solar project in Waco, Texas. The deal will last for 20 years and is expected to match the electricity requirements of Colgate Palmolives entire US operations once the site is commissioned in late 2024. Markum solar will be Scout Clean Energys first greenfield solar project, and it said that construction which it will manage itself is due to start this Autumn. Power actually produced at the project will go into Texas' ERCOT transmission network. With the PPA and construction contracts executed, we are extremely excited to move forward with the 209MW Markum Solar project. These contracts provide Scout the certainty to build our first solar project, said Michael Rucker, CEO and founder of Scout Clean Energy. Ann Tracy, chief sustainability officer at Colgate Palmolive said VPPAs are a valuable part of our renewable energy master plan and will help us achieve our targets of net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030. Scout Clean Energy is a subsidiary of Brookfield Renewable, one of the largest renewable energy asset owners in the US. Brookfield purchased the company in September last year alongside Standard Solar in a deal valued at roughly US $ 2 billion. Brookfield recently announced plans to commission 18GW worth of renewable energy projects in the next three years across its asset portfolio, particularly targeting the growing market for corporate PPAs like this one with Colgate Palmolive. In June the company bought the renewables development arm of utility Duke Energy for US $ 28 billion, and March saw Brookfield acquire both Australian Origin Energy and European developer X Elio, the latter from fellow investor KKR'"", ""'Scout Clean Energy, a Colorado based renewable energy developer, owner and operator, has signed a power purchase agreement with Colgate Palmolive for power from Scouts 209 MW DC Markum Solar Farm near Waco, Texas. This fall, Scout will begin and manage project construction. Markum will generate enough clean energy for the ERCOT grid to power approximately 32,200 homes. Virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) are a valuable part of our renewable energy master plan and will help us achieve our targets of net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030, says Ann Tracy, Colgate Palmolive chief sustainability officer, in an announcement. Markum is in both McLennan and Bosque Counties and is scheduled for delivery in 2024. The project will result in approximately 300 temporary construction jobs and three permanent full time positions when the facility begins operation. Economic benefits to the community from new tax revenue over the life of the project are expected to be significant. Scout Clean Energy is a portfolio company of Brookfield Renewable, a publicly traded, pure play renewable power platform. Brookfield acquired Scout at the beginning of 2023, and Scout continues to execute on its significant growth plans. Scouts legal advisor was Stoel Rives LLP and Colgate Palmolives legal advisor on the transaction was Morgan, Lewis & Bockius"", 'CPPA is much more integrated into the supply agreement making it much easier, and crucially efficient, to set up and run. Whereas the traditional CPPA was typically a long term fixed price (with indexation) agreement, the new breed of CPPAs are much more like a conventional energy supply contract. They can incorporate fixed prices or flexible market price deals, enabling businesses to choose between price stability or access to more market reflective rates. These new CPPAs are integrated into more familiar energy supply agreements, so a business may opt for a five year CPPA with a solar power generator, and then secure the rest of their energy via a green energy supply contract with options available to ensure they can still know the source of their green energy. The new short term CPPAs offer a really simple, low risk way for businesses to access renewable energy generation because the CPPA is provided by an energy supplier that has an established long term PPA with the generator. This type of agreement eliminates the need for complex balancing or sleeving agreements and legal contracts. Short term arrangements enable businesses to dip their toe into the world of CPPAs or even make the transition to more traditional CPPAs. The difference between a corporate PPA and a standard green energy supply contract is that it enables a business to know before the contract starts precisely which generator its renewable electricity will be coming from, and access fixed prices for this in advance. The new corporate PPAs add to the carbon free energy options available to businesses. Of course, one of the most direct ways to source renewable electricity is to install green generation assets on your own site. For those businesses that have the space available, supplying your own premises directly has many benefits, such as avoiding a number of import and other costs. However, many businesses are unlikely to have enough room on site to install sufficient renewable generation assets to meet all of their energy requirements. In this situation, businesses can mix and match different renewable energy supply strategies. So, a proportion of requirements could be met by on site solar panels or wind turbines, and the rest made up with a green electricity supply contract or corporate PPA. The holy grail of renewable energy purchasing is additionality supporting the development of new renewable generation assets that displace fossil fuel based generation. The original long term', ""'Solar developer Lightsource bp has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with American Electric Powers subsidiary AEP Energy Partners for a 188MWdc project in Indiana, US. The Honeysuckle Solar project will begin commercial operation next year while construction has already started on site. Lightsource bp will finance, build, own and operate the facility and sell the generated solar energy to AEP Energy Partners under a long term PPA. The project also involves other solar PV product manufacturers, including solar PV solutions provider First Solar, which supplies solar panels solar tracker technology provider Array Technologies, which offers smart solar trackers and steel producer Nucor. This PPA is a great example of how energy buyers with sustainability goals can work with us to spur the buildout of new solar projects that will improve the health and energy security of communities across the US while helping strengthen local economies, said Kevin Smith, Lightsource bps CEO of the Americas. Greg Hall, executive vice president and chief commercial officer of AEP, added, The partnership with Lightsource bp demonstrates our commitment to the development of new renewable resources that both empower local communities and support a cleaner, brighter energy future. Earlier this month, Lightsource bp signed a PPA with fast food giant McDonalds for a 145MWac/180MWdc PV project in Louisiana. McDonalds will offtake the entirety of the power produced at the Prairie Ronde solar project, which is expected to generate around 327,000MWh annually. Lightsource bp will handle financing, construction and operation of the facility construction is set to begin in early 2023, with commercial operation set for late 2024. Lightsource said that it will invest US $ 39 million a year in maintaining the facility and the surrounding land'"", ""off takers credit risks. Depending on a countrys regulatory framework, alongside CfDs and PPAs, purely merchant investments will be needed too. This is essential for electricity producers to meet their obligations under PPAs. Producers often need to buy electricity on the spot market to meet their obligations to deliver power to the off taker under a PPA. This means they also need to sell some of their production on the spot market in order to have matching revenue. It remains to be seen whether the EU will be able to adopt these reforms in autumn 2023 they may only come into force in 2024. With the pioneering AlpinSolar facility at 2,500 meters in the Swiss mountains, Axpo became the first company in Switzerland to develop and successfully execute an entire PPA project. Elsewhere in Europe, Axpo Deutschland concluded the very first PPA in the German solar market back in 2019. Axpo has set itself the goal of significantly increasing its long term purchase and supply contracts for electricity from renewable energies and we continue to facilitate the use of PPAs across Europe and beyond, especially in markets heavily dependent on conventional fuels.

ZeroAvia secured the permit to fly following an extensive ground testing campaign and a rigorous review of the full development program. It means that ZeroAvia, the leader in zero emission aviation, can now begin the first test flights of its 600kW hydrogen electric powertrain. The 19 seat twin engine aircraft has been retrofitted in an engineering testbed configuration to incorporate ZeroAvias hydrogen electric engine powering the propellor on its left wing, operating alongside a single Honeywell TPE 331 stock engine on the right for appropriate redundancy to allow the safe testing of the novel propulsion technology. The test flights are set to be a landmark achievement for ZeroAvia and the HyFlyer II project, a major R & D program backed by the UK Governments ATI Programme, which targets the development of a 600kW hydrogen electric powertrain for 9 19 seat aircraft. For this testing program, ZeroAvia has worked with the CAA in meeting a far more stringent set of requirements when compared to the E Conditions framework ZeroAvia had used for its 6 seat prototype in 2020. Part 21 is an industry standard term used to describe the regulatory approval of aircraft design and production organizations, and the certification of products, parts, and appliances for aircraft. Securing this permit to fly is a significant milestone in ZeroAvias path towards commercialization. Val Miftakhov, Founder & CEO of ZeroAvia said Earning our full Part 21 permit to fly with the CAA is a critical milestone as we develop a zero emission aviation propulsion system that will be the most environmental and economical solution to the industrys climate impact. Were going to be starting 2023 in the best way possible, by demonstrating through flight that true zero emission commercial flight is much closer than many think. It will pave the way for a commercially certifiable configuration for ZA600 to be submitted by the end of 2023, ahead of delivering powertrains for the first commercial routes for 9 19 seat aircraft to commence by 2025. With 1,500 engines under pre order, partnerships with seven aircraft manufacturers and multiple fuel and airport partnerships, ZeroAvia is well positioned to lead the industrys transformation to a clean future. When test flights begin in January, ZeroAvias Dornier 228 testbed is', 'electric engine was retrofitted onto the left wing of the Dornier 228, a twin engine aircraft, while a Honeywell TPE 331 stock engine was left in place on the right wing. During testing, the hydrogen electric powertrain contained two fuel cell stacks, with lithium ion battery packs supplying peak power support during take off and adding additional redundancy to ensure a safe testing program. While the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems were stored inside the cabin during the tests, commercial flights would require external storage in order to carry passengers inside the craft. The latest breakthrough in hydrogen electric aviation comes under the remit of the R & D HyFlyer II project, a program that the UK Governments ATI Program supports. ZeroAvias goal with HyFlyer II is to develop a 600 kW powertrain to achieve commercial zero emission flight globally using 9 19 seat aircraft. To fuel the hydrogen electric powertrain onboard the 19 seat Dornier 228 aircraft, an on site electrolyzer was used to produce compressed gaseous hydrogen. In order to facilitate on site hydrogen production, ZeroAvia, in partnership with its HyFlyer II associate, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), developed the Hydrogen Airport Refuelling Ecosystem (HARE). The HARE infrastructure provides insight into what on site green hydrogen production, storage, refueling and fuel cell powered flight could look like in the future. Moreover, ZeroAvia and EMEC demonstrated the ability to double the systems electrolyzer capacity for the latest project. This is only the beginning we are building the future of sustainable, zero climate impact aviation. Moving forward, ZeroAvia will continue to develop and scale its hydrogen electric powertrains towards a certifiable configuration that could see zero emission commercial routes taking to the skies as early as 2025. Under the HyFlyer II project, the Dornier 228 will continue to take a number of test flights from the R & D facility at Cotswold Airport and later go on to take test flights from other airports. Having put another worlds first feather in its cap, ZeroAvia continues to make history and build some serious momentum towards commercial success with 1,500 engines already on pre order and landing partnerships with seven aircraft manufacturers. The company has also managed to secure an engine order from American Airlines and lock in infrastructure partnerships with a number of international airports, including Rotterdam,', ""'The US firm ZeroAvia is one step closer to bringing its zero emission electric aircraft to market, powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The jet tracking social media account ElonJet has drawn renewed attention to the role of private and corporate aircraft in blurting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The issue can be an embarrassing one for electric car makers and other businesses that portray themselves as planet savers. Fortunately, help is on the way. Batteries and fuel cells are in a neck and neck race to nudge zero emission electric aircraft out of the workshed and onto the runway. Batteries and fuel cells have already scaled up for a wide range of heavy duty ground applications, including semi trucks, locomotives, and construction vehicles along with stationary energy storage systems. Sending them up on an airplane is a different matter entirely, but a flurry of activity this past fall indicates that zero emission aircraft are close at hand. In the battery area, for example, last fall the US startup Eviation laid claim to the first public test flight of a 9 seat battery powered airplane. The company Heart Aerospace is also on track for commercial development of its 30 seat, battery powered electric aircraft. Hydrogen fuel cell aircraft have been emerging at a similar pace. In December, the US startup ZeroAvia announced that its retrofitted 19 seat Dornier 228 hydrogen fuel cell electric aircraft has received permission to fly from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA permission slip validates ZeroAvias engineering and ground testing regimen, opening the gate to commercialization. The Dornier builds on ZeroAvias earlier work on a six seat electric aircraft. The initial focus is on a range of 300 miles for the 19 seater. ZeroAvia anticipates bumping that up to 700 miles for 40 80 seats by 2027.

The latest seasonal outlook from the National Interagency Fire Center largely points to such a reprieve at least for the next few months. This years potential reprieve is the perfect time to ramp up wildfire resilience building efforts that would prepare us for future wildfire seasons. Over the past 30 40 years, wildfire data show a clear signal from climate change As global temperatures have warmed over the past several decades, western wildfires have worsened by nearly every metric, from the number, size, and severity of fires to the length of wildfire season. Lets dive into western wildfires by the numbers. As spring turns to summer and the days warm up, the Northern Hemisphere enters the period known as Danger Season, when wildfires, heat waves, and hurricanes, all amplified by climate change, begin to ramp up. In the western United States, the start of Danger Season is marked by the shift from the wintertime wet season to the summertime dry season. While wildfires can and do occur all year round, this shift from cool and wet to warm and dry marks the start of wildfire season in the region. According to the latest seasonal outlook from the National Interagency Fire Center, the exceptionally rainy and snowy conditions the west experienced during the winter of 2022 2023 are translating to below average to normal levels of wildfire risk across most western states at least through August. That said, above normal activity is expected for parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. Some scientists are also raising concerns that all the young grasses and other plants that have sprung up as a result of the wet weather could quickly turn into dry kindling for wildfires as the dry season wears on into late summer and fall. According to the latest wildland fire outlook, most of the western United States is expected to experience either normal or below normal fire activity between May and August this year. Source National Interagency Fire Center. There are many different ways to measure wildfire activity, but by almost any metric, wildfires across the western US and southwestern Canada are worsening.

Current drought conditions in Florida are expected to improve or go away during the next three months. Areas of extreme to exceptional drought across parts of the southern High Plains are likely to persist through the spring season, with drought also expected to develop into parts of New Mexico. Across parts of the Northwest United States and northern Rockies, drought conditions are also expected to continue. Drought may develop into parts of Washington state. Above average temperatures are favored for much of the southern and eastern half of the United States For April through June, the greatest chance for above average temperatures exists from the southern High Plains eastward to Florida, and northward along the East Coast. Above average temperatures are also likely for Hawaii and northern parts of Alaska. Below average temperatures are predicted for the central Great Basin and the northern Plains.

This peak is driven by various factors, including snowmelt, increased rainfall compared to winter, minimal vegetation to absorb water from the soil, and soil conditions that are either saturated or frozen. Understanding these contextual factors is crucial in comprehending the dynamics of streamflow in the Northeast region and their implications for water resource management and flood prediction. The researchers acknowledge in the study that one of the challenges with their model is that it relies on historical data and snowpack as a significant driver for predicting streamflow during the colder months. This presents a conundrum as the changing climate can alter snowpack dynamics, which may impact streamflow patterns in the future. As climate change continues to affect precipitation patterns and temperature regimes, it is crucial to continuously refine and update the model to account for potential shifts in snowpack dynamics and their implications for streamflow projections in the Northeast region. As the researchers explain, when the model encounters future dates with reduced snowpack due to global warming, it predicts a decrease in streamflow. However, as Charlotte Cockburn, the first author of the study, points out, the models may not fully capture the dynamics of winter streamflow changes because they are trained on historical data, which may not fully account for the impact of climate change. In a warmer world due to climate change, rain is expected to play a more significant role in driving winter streamflow, which may not be adequately accounted for in the current model. This highlights the need for ongoing research and model refinement to better understand and predict the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow dynamics in the Northeast region. For the second part of the study, the team forced the machine learning model with a projection of climate from 2070 to 2099, to see what happens to streamflow in a future climate. Winter explains that if the Northeast region experiences wetter soils and more frequent heavy rainfall events, as predicted by climate models, it is likely to result in increased streamflow and higher flood risk. As the changing climate influences precipitation patterns and soil moisture conditions, it can have significant implications for streamflow dynamics and flood risk in the Northeast.

Is Mississipi an anti-ESG state?,yes,"Yes, Mississippi is considered an anti-ESG state.","[""'State office holders in Mississippi continue to spout anti ESG rhetoric, but a massive green hydrogen hub is taking shape right under their feet. The Energy Department launched an $ 8 billion hydrogen program last year, and state officials around the nation are scrambling to get a slice of the pie. In some cases they are even putting partisan politics aside. The latest example is the deep red state of Mississippi, where the firm Hy Stor Energy is working on a plan to transform the Magnolia State into a green hydrogen powerhouse. Mississippi is among two dozen or so states in which Republican governors, legislators, treasurers, and attorneys general have been railing against ESG (environmental, social governance) corporate risk management principles. As for why, thats not a mystery. In the context of climate change, one key way to manage risk is to decarbonize. Fossil energy stakeholders and their allies in public office have been pushing back, by trying to steer investor dollars away from renewable energy ventures. The anti ESG sentiment run deep in Mississippi, at least on the surface. Among those critical of ESG are Governor Tate Reeves, State Treasurer David McRae, both United States Senators Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde Smith, and the three GOP Congressmen, the Tate Record reported on March 21. Nevertheless, one hand doesnt seem to know what the other is doing. Last November, for example, Governor Reeves proudly announced that Indiana based Steel Dynamics is pumping $ 25 billion into an expansion of its existing campus in Mississippi, under the largest economic development deal in the states history. Steel Dynamics happens to be a founding member of the Global Steel Climate Council, which has proposed a new standard for greenhouse gas transparency in the steel industry. This new standard will accelerate the actual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and provide key decisionmakers with transparent and consistent data to make informed decisions, explained said Mark D. Millett, the companys Chairman and CEO in a press release in April. Steel Dynamics is beginning to walk the decarbonization walk. Among its recent moves is a new biocarbon venture to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to electric arc furnaces, which will be part of the newly expanded campus. Steel makers are also eyeballing green hydrogen as a pathway to steel decarbonization, meaning hydrogen produced from water or other renewable resources instead of natural gas and other fossil"", 'planning to bring wind energy into the electrolysis mix, that prospect has improved as well. The company AES is planning a 200 megawatt wind farm in Tunica County, which will be the first utility scale wind farm in the state. The anti ESG movement shows no signs of slowing down, despite the obvious contradiction involved in attracting investor dollars on the one hand, while bad mouthing investor ESG strategies on the other. In Mississippi, for example, Hy Stors financial partner is the firm Connor, Clark & Lund Infrastructure, which puts ESG front and center in its business model. We believe that a rigorous and continuous review of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG ) factors is fundamental to a well managed infrastructure portfolio and we consider ESG in our analysis of each investment, CCL states. ESG considerations are deeply integrated throughout our investment process from initial assessment through decision making and during ongoing ownership, they add. Interesting! Hy Stor and CCL seem to have the environmental leg of ESG well in hand, but the social part of the equation could be a sticky wicket in terms of attracting and retaining top talent. Republican office holders in Mississippi continue to push the state into the bottom of the reproductive and human rights barrel, making the state an unsafe place for women, girls and transgender persons.

ESG refers to environmental, social, and governance corporate and investment principles that are intended to manage risk and promote long term financial viability in the context of climate change and other 21st century challenges, which puts renewable energy investing in the spotlight. In its official statement adopting ESG guidelines, the Council noted that it has a long term investment horizon and recognizes that the successful management of the Funds is linked to global economic growth. Consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, the State Investment Office seeks to invest in entities that strive for long term sustainability in their operations, the Council added. As such, in investing and managing the assets of the Funds, the SIO will consider ESG factors which can present material business risks or opportunities. Proposed legislation that shifts oil and gas regulation in New Mexico from a protectionist model to an environmental conservation model could also help keep the investor dollars flowing into renewable energy projects. In Arizona, proposed anti ESG legislation is placing policy makers in a more fraught position, but some are pushing back. In Arizona, treasurers in 14 of its 15 counties wrote an open letter to the legislature begging lawmakers not to pass two bills that they said would politicize our government procurement process at the cost of our state economy and the Arizona taxpayer, Bloomberg reported in March. Proposed anti ESG legislation or not, it looks like Arizona is getting many megawatts of wind energy to share around with California thanks to the SunZia project, helping to hasten the exit of fossil fuels from the US power generation profile. Arizona is also set to play a key role in shepherding fossil fuels out of the market for industrial process heat. Last week, Arizona State University announced that the US Department of Energy has tapped it to lead the new Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institute as part of a sprawling public private decarbonization effort called Electrified Processes for Industry Without Carbon, or EPIXC or short. With ASU in the lead, EPIXC has enlisted national laboratories and prominent academic institutions across the country to kick fossil fuels out of iron and steel, chemicals, petroleum, food and beverage, forest products, and cement, among other industries. Somewhat ironically, the list of partner institutions includes several located in states', 'application for up to $ 1 billion in funding for MCHH, through the Energy Departments Clean Hydrogen Hub program. The MCHHs geological endowment and critical access to the heartland of the United States via major logistics and shipping corridors make it a vital hydrogen storage and transmission location, Hy Stor emphasized in a press release announcing the application, adding that the company is already engaging with industrial, logistics, and community partners in states throughout the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico. Hy Stor also noted that MCHH has already received considerable private sector funding and is on track to break ground soon, possibly later this year. Development of the MCHH will put the entire state of Mississippi at the forefront of efforts to strengthen regional energy resilience, establish partnerships to prioritize education, and pursue equitable distribution of energy investments, the company enthused. The MCHH will supply zero carbon hydrogen in large quantities around the clock, enabling energy intensive industries, including steel, chemicals and agri nutrients, to decarbonize their operations rapidly and lead the way toward a low carbon future, Hy Stor emphasized. MCHH will enable the transition of existing manufacturing and transportation systems to lower carbon sources of energy, and will attract new, low emission industrial manufacturing capacity to Mississippi, the company added for good measure. As a ripple effect, MCHH could help provide Mississippis renewable energy industries with a much needed shot of adrenaline. The state has been drifting around in the wind and solar power doldrums in terms of installed capacity, but activity is finally beginning to pick up. Earlier this year, the energy company Entergy hit the start button on a new 100 megawatt solar array, the biggest utility owned array in the state so far. The new facility kicks off Entergys five year, 1,000 megawatt solar power plan. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that the state will add a total of 2,494 megawatts of solar power over the next five years, bumping it up to a respectable # 18 in the trade groups state by state solar ranking. If Hy Stor is planning to bring wind energy into the electrolysis mix, that prospect has improved as well. The company AES is planning a 200 megawatt wind farm in Tunica County, which will be the first utility scale wind farm in the state. The anti ESG movement shows no signs of slowing down, despite the obvious', ""to a new factory that will churn out steel for the offshore wind industry, despite the anti ESG saber rattling of State Attorney General Daniel Cameron. The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority approved a 15 year incentive package for the new plant. Then theres West Virginia, which is on track to manufacture coal killing energy storage modules and ship them all around the country. Republican Governor Jim Justice and other state officials support the project, as does the West Virginia Economic Development Authority, even though State Treasurer Riley Moore has loudly declaimed the evils of ESG investing. Indianas wireless EV charging project is another example. If all goes according to plan, Magments magnetic concrete will be poured onto roads all across the country. Nevertheless, the states Republican Governor, Eric J. Holcomb, came out firmly in favor of the project when it launched in 2021. Indiana is known as the Crossroads of America and were committed to fortifying our position as a transportation leader by innovating to support the emerging vehicle technology, he said. This partnership to develop wireless charging technology for highways sends a strong signal that Indiana is on the leading edge of delivering the infrastructure needed to support the adoption of electric vehicles, he added. Meanwhile, though, Indiana State Attorney General Todd Rokita is among other state officials leading the charge against woke capitalism. As reported by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, last September Rokita held a virtual event to announce his official advisory opinion on the matter. Woke big businesses are collaborating with their leftist allies to subvert the will of the people, Rokita said. This includes investing Hoosiers' pensions in ways that work against the best interest of Indiana families. As summarized by the Chronicle, that means Indiana and its investment managers cant make government employee pension system investments based on environmental, social or governance criteria. Earlier this year the Indiana State Legislature chimed in with a pair of bills aimed at preventing the states pension funds from prioritizing ESG factors, and ordering them to divest in investments related to China, to boot. If the bills pass into law, they may not necessarily slow Indianas march towards an all electric future. However, it is not a good look for Indiana businesses in general, and the leading road construction materials firm The Heritage Group in particular.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.18834850184505136
Can you hang solar panels on garden fences?,yes,"Yes, you can hang solar panels on garden fences.","[""'I recently wrote about tiltable, portable solar panels that are ideal for agrivoltaic installations. Scaling down from the farm to the garden level, another company is now offering plug & play solar panels that you can hang on garden fences. German startup Green Akku has created this clever little solar PV option (There are a lot of home gardens in Germany, and a lot of interest in solar) As you can see in the picture above, you basically just hang and clip the solar panels on the fence. And then you enjoy all the electricity they create. The cost of these solar power systems which include solar modules, inverters, and special brackets is just 41681 ($ 44883). That seems ridiculously low to me, but it is what it is. Reportedly, there is no need for a permit when using these solar panels (That may vary by jurisdiction) And the kit comes with everything needed to connect the panels to the fence. This is what the company has to say about its garden fence solar PV Thanks to the vertical attachment of the modules to the property or garden fence, particularly high yields are achieved when the sun is low. This means that the fence system performs much better than a roof system, especially when a lot of energy is needed, ie in the morning and evening hours. The complete sets consist of PV modules, micro inverters, mounting material and come with everything you need for the installation. Even the tool. They can be flexibly attached to existing fences and thus optimally adapt to your needs. Before these garden fence solar PV systems, Green Akku was in the business of selling solar PV panels for balconies. With a balcony power plant, you can produce environmentally friendly electricity on your own balcony and thus not only reduce your electricity bill, but also make a contribution to climate protection, the company writes about this topic. A complete package consists of just a few components and can be installed easily and with little effort. The solar modules are placed on the balcony, terrace or roof and connected to the inverter via a cable. This converts the direct current generated into usable alternating current, which is fed directly into the power grid or can be temporarily stored in a battery.

They found the proposed approach is technically and economically viable, provided careful wind load tests are conducted on the fences. A US Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low cost racking solution for solar modules. This is perhaps the lowest cost approach to racking, the research's corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told PV Magazine. What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free. The researchers identified three main typologies of fencing fences based on multiple battens placed between the main posts to support the fence wire fences using posts on which the fence wires or mesh are attached and fences utilizing prefabricated meshes of various designs suitable to the need and sometimes aesthetics. Normally for fences, high tensile steel wires and mild steel wire are predominantly used, they noted. Their diametric dimensions are generally 4 mm, 315 mm and 25 mm for high tensile (HT) wire and mild steel wires. In order to ascertain if an existing fence may be used for solar deployment, developers should first investigate if the fence can withstand a certain wind load in a specific location with the addition of PV panels, as well as the region's topological, geographical and climatic challenges. In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts. The scientists also explained that wind load measurements should be taken via the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and Components & Cladding (C & C) procedures, as well as by the Open Source Wind Load Calculator, which is a tool used to calculate the wind load on a fence in a given region in the United States. The program outputs the wind loads in terms of the base shear force in pound force (lbf) and base moment in feet pound force (ft lbf), they specified, adding that they calculated for a range of wind loads from 80 mph to 150 mph (129 km/h to 241 km/h).

The academics conducted a series of field tests using three Cheetah HC 72 M monocrystalline PERC panels manufactured by China based JinkoSolar. They said their installation was performed quickly by two people, with the mounting of a single module requiring seven minutes and a total of four zip ties. They also conducted a series of simulations for retrofitting existing farm fencing for a wide range of farms, including sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and alpaca, and found solar projects based on the proposed approach would be economically viable in the United States. The cost of the racking retrofit is only the cost of four stainless steel zip ties per module, which can be purchased in 120 packs for $ 11 or about 37 cents per module, they explained. If the modules range in power from 250 to 500 W then the racking cost of an existing fence is less than a penny a Watt. Pearce said the research group also laid out what would be an optimal inverter strategy depending on how much energy a farmer would need. Small scale farmers can use the free ebook to set up the design for the system, do the install with metal zip ties themselves, and then only need to call an electrician to attach to the grid, he concluded. The scientists presented their findings in the paper The potential for fencing to be used as low cost solar photovoltaic racking, published in Solar Energy. Future work is necessary to determine the full scope of the benefits of this approach of vertical PV agricultural fencing on a global scale, they said, looking forward to how to improve the proposed methodology.

But crop production doesnt necessarily need to pause when solar is installed. More farms are now co locating solar panels, livestock grazing and crops, in a practice known as agrivoltaics. While still in its infancy, agrivoltaics greatly benefits farms and their surrounding communities. Many crops, such as lettuce, peppers and tomatoes, do better with the intermittent shade from solar panels, resulting in higher crop yields. Studies are being conducted across the United States to determine which crops thrive with solar panels. The shade from the panels also reduces a farms water use. This benefit is especially welcome in a state like California, which has some of the countrys prime agricultural land and also been dealing with years of drought. Its becoming more common for solar farms to incorporate native grasses or pollinator friendly plants with solar panels. Attracting pollinators can increase yields on farms with solar installations and even on neighboring farms, benefitting the larger community. Livestock grazing can also be combined with solar farms, helping maintain the vegetation while providing some shade for the animals. When farmers and their communities get the facts about solar, they can readily see its many benefits. Learning about those benefits can shift rural communities from seeing solar as a threat to seeing it as a way to preserve American farmland. As solar developers, its up to us to spread the word that solar is a win win win for farms, rural communities, and our country as a whole. Geoff Sparrow is VP of Development for Green Lantern Solar.

QC was earlier handled manually by experts. However, due to manpower and time constraints, manual QC of huge datasets is not practical. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' (CAS) Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) and their associates offer a novel climatological range based automatic quality control system for ocean temperature in situ profiles. This system is known as CAS Ocean Data Center Quality Control system, or CODC QC for short, and comprises 14 distinct quality checks to pinpoint outliers. The research was published in the journal Deep Sea Research Part I. We developed this new QC system to provide a quality homogenous database, with reduced human workload and time cost on manual QC. In CODC QC, the 05% and 995% quantiles are used as thresholds to define local climatological ranges. These thresholds are time varying, with the goal of incorrectly excluding real data during extreme events. These strategies are used in local climatological range checks for both temperature and vertical temperature gradient, where the anisotropic feature of water properties is attributed to, and topography barriers adjustment of water mass is made. Furthermore, the CODC QC systems performance was evaluated using two expert/manual QC ed benchmark datasets. This evaluation confirmed the effectiveness of the suggested strategy in deleting false data and reducing the percentage of valuable data incorrectly flagged. The CODC QC was also applied to the global World Ocean Database (WOD18), which included 16,804,361 temperature profiles spanning the years 1940 to 2021. According to temperature outlier statistics, 797% of measurements were rejected, with XBT data having the highest rejection rate (1544%) and the Argo profiling float having the lowest rejection rate (239%). We suggest a dependency of the quality of temperature observations on the instrumentation type. The investigators also used the CODC QC system to study global ocean warming.

The RTC 168 features a new well design allowing sanitary sensors with large flanges to get closer to the temperature uniformity zone than before for improved accuracy and faster calibration time. A redesigned sensor basket combined with a temperature equalizer and a faster magnetic stirrer help create an extended temperature uniformity zone for liquid calibrations. With the uniformity zone extended vertically, the sensing element in shorter sensors can now reach it, resulting in improved calibrations. One difficulty in calibrating sanitary sensors is that traditional bath methods result in inconsistent heat transfer to the flange of the sensor due to liquid flow and level changes. The new RTC 168 temperature calibrator includes a patent pending calibration technique for liquid calibration of sanitary sensors, allowing operators to replicate in field use during their liquid calibration resulting in a sensor calibration that closely matches its day to day use. JOFRA's new design isolates the liquid in the main block from the excess liquid around the flange. This isolation removes the liquid flow effect and the need for a precise liquid level, making it easier to calibrate under multiple conditions. The heat transfer to the flange is handled through the aluminum of the heat conveyor rather than through the liquid, creating a much more consistent transfer. In addition, the heat conveyor optimizes the liquid circulation in the block for the calibration of sanitary sensors. In addition, the RTC 168 calibrator also features an industry first reverse flow cooling technique. This technique pushes the hot air out of the bottom of the calibrator rather than the top. This innovation protects the customer's sensor under test from"", 'utilize the Barcelona Expert Centers Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SSS maps. The BEC SMOS SSS global product v2 comprises a time series of 9 day level 3 salinity maps created daily at a 025 025 grid from 2011 to 2018. In situ salinity data are not used for calibration in the salinity retrieval technique. As a result, the worldwide average of SMOS salinity is set to the global standard of yearly salinity climatology on each map. The yearly climatological salinity value published by the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA2013) at 025 025 is used as a salinity reference. The average decadal product, which can be found at the National Oceanographic Data Center, is what researchers utilize. Over the values of Argo measurements, researchers undertake the following quality control For Argo profiles, the cut off depth is between 5 and 10 m. Greylist profiles (floats that may have difficulties with one or more sensors) are deleted. Researchers utilize WOA2013 as a quality indicator When compared to WOA2013, Argo float profiles with temperature or salinity anomalies of more than 10 C or 5 psu are eliminated. Only profiles with temperature acquisitions close to the surface between 25 and 40 C and salinity between 2 and 41 psu are used compared to WOA2013. All remotely sensed surface winds produced from scatterometers and radiometers available are used as observation inputs for the objective approach dealing with the computation of 6 hourly wind fields across the worldwide seas to estimate the 6 hourly blended wind products. The average salinity at the Argo sites in a 9 day window develops over time over large oceanic regions, such as those between 60 S and 60 N. It is considerably different from the temporal history of the mean salinity in the whole region, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Temporal evolution of the averaged salinity in between 60 S and 60 N.

In the bottom plot the average domain is common and is given by the satellite coverage. The variations in the annual climatology (grey line, bottom plot) correspond to the variations in the satellite coverage that mainly corresponds with the changes in the sea ice mask.

This area is of significant ecological importance, supporting a complex marine ecosystem. A focus of coastal oceanographic research since the early 1900s, the area supports a wide variety of marine life, including many commercially important and highly endangered species, like the North Atlantic right whale. Despite their large size, right whales feed on tiny copepods (planktonic zooplankton), straining huge volumes of seawater through their baleen plates. These whales are one of the worlds most endangered large whale species, with latest estimates suggesting there are fewer than 350 individuals remaining. This spring, marine monitoring instruments known as Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) will be collecting plankton samples in the region, helping to provide the big picture on ocean health. CPRs were towed in the Mid Atlantic Bight between 1976 and 2013, operated by NOAAs Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and between 2014 and 2017 by the CPR Survey. Due to lack of funding, analysis of the samples was paused in 2014, and in 2017 CPRs stopped towing. Retrospective analysis of 2014 2017 samples by the CPR Survey was made possible by funding from Lenfest, which increased the available dataset to 50 years, a substantial time series for ocean science. The newly reinstated tow route, known as the MB route, will form part of the international monitoring effort coordinated by the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, based at the Marine Biological Association. Established in 1931, the Survey has deployed CPRs in every ocean, covering more than 7 million nautical miles, for which it was recently awarded a Guinness World Records title. Today, the Survey continues to provide unrivalled information on the health of the oceans, with resulting data used to underpin national and international marine policies. CPRs are simple mechanical instruments that have been used to collect plankton samples all over the world.

Why are milder winters detrimental for grapes and apples?,"Milder winters are detrimental for grapes and apples because these perennial species rely on consistent winter conditions for proper dormancy and bud timing, and erratic temperature swings disrupt these processes, making it difficult for growers to manage.",Milder winters can be detrimental for grapes and apples because they can lead to early budbreak.,"[""More mild winters with erratic changes in temperature, such as the one we're experiencing, could have damaging effects on both grape and apple crops across New York state. Jason Londo, associate professor of fruit crop physiology and climate adaptation, says he doesn't expect there has been much damage this year so far, but he has concerns about early budbreak leading to a higher risk of frost damage in the region. This winter has been much more mild overall than normal, and it is having an effect on both apples and grapes across New York state. In my program we track winter hardiness, the ability of grapes and apples to avoid freeze damage. For both crops, cold hardiness is weaker than in past years, mostly due to our very mild November and December. We don't expect that there is much damage this year so far, but as we get closer to spring, I do have concerns that we will see early budbreak. In our region, that means a higher risk of frost damage. I m hoping that we keep the temperatures low, bouncing around the freeze point, in order to keep apple and grape buds dormant. Winter is very important for both grapevines and apple trees. The time spent during the winter looks very boring to us, the trees and vines lack leaves and fruit and appear asleep. However, very important changes in internal physiology are happening all through winter. Those changes are necessary for synchronized budbreak and flowering in the coming growing season. Since grapes and apples are perennial species, they have adapted to consistent climate patterns and have fine tuned their winter responses to help them enter dormancy in the fall at the right time, and break bud in the spring at the right time. As our winter's get more mild, they are also getting more erratic. It is very difficult for growers to mitigate these sorts of large scale swings in temperature. Cornell University has dedicated television and audio studios available for media interviews"", ""A West Virginia University expert is offering insights on the effects lingering winter weather and fluctuating temperatures could have on trees, shrubs and flowers heading into the official start of spring on Monday, March 20. Mira Danilovich, associate professor with WVU Extension and the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design and consumer horticulture Extension specialist, has insights on how plants weather up and down temperatures. With hot spells followed by temperatures in the mid 20s and low 30s, some trees and flowers will start to move. Swollen buds are a sign that water has started to flow through the trees. When it comes to flowering trees, if the flowers are swollen but not open yet, they can sustain temperatures in high to mid 20s with only minor injury. Throughout West Virginia, many people have fruit trees planted on their property. How the weather affects flowers in fruit trees truly depends on the stage of the flower bud development. Right now, most of the fruit trees still appear tight and swollen, with some early green on the buds. Fruit trees at this stage can sustain temperatures into the high teens. Curled up and crinkled leaves or dark patches on the flower petals are signs of cold injury. Unopened flowers might be a bit crinkled too. Some of the cells might have been injured and, on that side, the growth will be slower than on the side where there was no damage. In other words, growth may appear lopsided. Our flowers and plants affected by the freezing temperatures will recuperate, but still show the'scars of the frost encounter. Late fall and early spring are the best times to prune your trees, shrubs and other plants. I encourage people to start sprucing up and cutting back their plants in mid March just as spring officially arrives. Mira Danilovich, associate professor and consumer horticulture specialist, WVU Extension"", 'agrivoltaics in pear orchards, said. But the increased albedo by the white plastics will definitely increase the total gain. What is more, the groundsheets also prevent weeds from growing near the roots of the trees and slow water evaporation another important saving, as research performed by Chad Higgins and Hadi al Agele at Oregon State University inferred. Agrivoltaics can provide a viable path toward water sustainability in agriculture, they said. Combining solar with orchards is undoubtedly a good idea particularly for orchardists, continued Willockx. This comes down to the trellising method of orchard plantation itself, which utilizes the shade provided by the solar panels to protect fruits from excessive irradiance, while also allowing the trees to grow taller. Less water is also required due to reduced transpiration. This is particularly useful in Israel, where the sunny weather is excellent for solar energy nearly all year long, said Noyman. Unfortunately, we can not escape global warming, and days of extreme heat waves and lack of precipitation take a toll on farmers, he added. The ability of agrivoltaic methods to create micro climates, therefore, becomes particularly important. According to Noyman, the biggest challenges to orchardvoltaics are on the voltaics side. We do not see a big difference between an integrated plantation and any other solar project, he said, adding that the barriers of connecting to a network and finding PPAs are the same barriers that exist in this model as well. The challenges of a large scale rollout include a connection to an overhead powerline, as well as a sub station. These are, of course, the challenges faced by any large scale solar project, but not all of them can bear fruit before they start to generate energy. There may be other challenges too, said Willockx. For instance, orchards are perennial crops, and it may not be that the effects of shading on yield will be visible for several years. Moreover, and this is a challenge faced by agrivoltaics generally, the balance between the crop and the solar is often not the most financially optimal. That challenge is, of course, strongly dependent on the country and indeed the crop. Given a highly irradiated country and a strong crop demand, financial optimization should not be a major issue. The benefits of orchardvoltaics seem particularly suited to semiarid regions like Israel. In a 2019 paper in Nature titled Agrivoltaics provide mutual benefits across the food', 'From 1980 to 2009, farmers faced an ever increasing chance of having to deal with a growing season that was too hot and dry for their crops, according to a new study from an international team led by researchers at Aalto University. Wheat growers saw the biggest change, with the chance of extreme heat and drought during the growing season increasing sixfold over the study period. The risk for maize, rice, and soybean doubled a smaller increase, but nevertheless considerable. The researchers also investigated the effect of these conditions on crop yields. Their model showed that heat and drought reduced wheat yields by about 4% overall, though some regions saw much greater reductions, notably parts of Russia and China, both major global producers globally. Likewise, maize yields were about 3% lower because of hot and dry weather, but the losses were more severe in areas of North America, Eastern Europe and China. As the threat of weather extremes hurting global food production grows, we need to find ways to help farmers adapt to adverse weather conditions, and we also have to reduce the emissions causing these changes in the climate, says postdoctoral researcher Matias Heino, who led the study.

Woese Institute for Genomic Biology Most studies that measure the effects of climate change are looking at year to year changes, which are representative of variations in weather and not climate. We used data across 60 years to examine how deviations in weather from long term averages affect the yields of three major cereal crops rice, maize, and wheat. Madhu Khanna, Professor, Agriculture and Consumer Economics, Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology Weather changes are short, like a hot day followed by a thunderstorm. Such variations, however, may be distinct from long term trends that characterize climate change. We were looking to see if the effect of short term deviations in extreme temperature and precipitation are significant when compared to their long term averages and if their effects are absent in the long term as farmers adapt to climate change. Madhu Khanna, Professor, Agriculture and Consumer Economics, Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology The investigators employed quantile regression models to see if farmers were adapting to long term climate changes. They created separate models for short term and long term crop responses using 60 year data sets on temperature, precipitation, growing season length, and crop yield. According to their research, if temperature differences, for example, did not have an impact on either model, no adaptations were made. On the other hand, if the short term impact is worse, the farmers appeared to have adapted to smooth out the effects. We found that the farmers were able to adapt to changes in temperature for rice and maize but not wheat. Increased precipitation enhanced rice yield, but adversely affected wheat and maize yields. We also found that farmers are customizing their strategies across different regions and crops.

What are the basic recycling steps for solar panels?,"removing the frames, glass covers, and solar connectors","The basic recycling steps for solar panels, as suggested by the context, include:

1.","[""'Back in 2018, one industry source said it was premature to focus on solar panel recycling in the United States, but almost five years later, significant steps are being taken to establish protocols to bring more sustainability to the solar industry. From solar panel recycling to waste cleanup on project sites to better packaging for shipments, the solar industry is greening up its image. Members of SEIAs PV Recycling Working Group began making recycling checklists and finding preferred partners in 2019, and a grassroots website (SolarRecycleorg) has collected information on reuse, resale and recycle outlets that accept solar materials. But the biggest step forward for the solar recycling space came with the 2022 founding of SolarCycle, a PV technology based recycler that opened a processing facility in Odessa, Texas, that recovers 95% of a solar panels value. Both national residential installer Sunrun and utility scale developer Silicon Ranch have inked partnerships with SolarCycle to process end of life modules. As Sunrun deploys PV systems at the scale needed to confront the climate crisis, weve embraced the responsibility and opportunity of managing the full lifecycle of our hardware, said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, in a statement. We are committed to sustainable end of life processes and excited to partner with an innovative company that shares our vision and is dedicated to creating a circular supply chain for the solar industry. In addition to end of life forward thinking, some innovators are working on ways to prevent premature solar panel scrapping due to delivery damage. PVpallet began testing its collapsible, plastic pallet in late 2021 and found a 100% success rate with Greentech Renewables delivering panels to Palmetto Solar. Where previously Greentech was reporting 10 broken modules each month, PVpallets vertically stacked setup prevented forklift damage and distributed weight during transit, leading to no broken panels. More distributors, including BayWa re have signed on to use PVpallets in warehouses and deliveries. Those reusable pallets also cut down on wooden pallet waste at project sites, a focus for Green Clean Solar. Founded by industry veteran Emilie OLeary in 2022, the company supports waste diversion by taking cardboard, shrink wrap and more refuse associated with solar product delivery out of landfills and into recycling centers. In addition to trash pickup, Green Clean Solar helps with solar panel decommissioning and complete"", ""'Researchers from the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, together with German PV module recycling company Reiling GmbH & Co. KG, have developed a solution in which silicon in discarded modules is recycled on an industrial scale and reused to produce new PERC solar cells. Most PV systems in Germany were installed between 2009 and 2011 during the first wave of PV expansion. Around 10,000 tons of silicon in discarded photovoltaic (PV) modules end up on the recycling market annually. This figure will rise to several hundred thousand tons per year by 2029. Currently, the aluminum, glass and copper of the discarded modules are reprocessed. However, the silicon solar cells are not. This expansion will foreseeably be followed by a first wave of disposal twenty years later, around 2029, when the feed in tariff for the installed PV modules expires, explains Prof. Dr. Andreas Bett, institute director of Fraunhofer ISE. Therefore, it is necessary to establish adequate processes and procedures for recovering the silicon material from the discarded modules at an early stage. Already in 2021, the total installed quantity of PV modules in Germany was about five million tons, with a silicon content of 150,000 tons. As a semiconductor material, silicon is the main component of solar cells. A working group at Fraunhofer CSP, together with Reiling GmbH & Co. KG, has therefore developed a process for recovering the silicon material with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate BMWK (formerly BMWi). With this process, it is possible to recycle all crystalline silicon PV modules, regardless of manufacturer and origin. If this were not the case, then this would be far too much work for the recycling companies, explains Prof. Dr. Peter Dold, project manager at Fraunhofer CSP. It was important for us to develop a scalable process that makes economic sense. A lot is possible in the lab, but our new process should prove itself in the practice for the recycling industry. For the process, solar cell fragments are separated and collected from by products of the mechanical recycling process, which is already established. At Fraunhofer CSP, the cell fragments with sizes from 01 to 1 millimeter are first freed from the glass and plastic by various sorting processes. This is followed by the step by step removal of the backside contact, the silver contacts, the anti reflective layer and"", ""One of the main reasons why people are fixing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in large numbers is to help the environment, but the industry is now struggling with the waste produced by 100,000 tons of panels due to be disassembled in Australia beginning in 2035. A recent study conducted at the University of South Australia has put forth a comprehensive product stewardship scheme for solar panels, which the Federal Government favored several years ago. According to UniSA researcher Professor Peter Majewski, incentives are required for producers to construct solar panels that can be more easily recycled if they are destroyed or out of warranty. The research was published in the journal AIMS Energy. Australia has one of the highest uptakes of solar panels in the world, which is outstanding, but little thought has been given to the significant volume of panels ending up in landfill 20 years down the track when they need to be replaced. There are some simple recycling steps that can be taken to reduce the waste volume, including removing the panels' frames, glass covers, and solar connectors before they are disposed of. Professor Majewski notes, Landfill bans are already in place in Victoria, following the lead of some European countries, encouraging existing installers to start thinking about recyclable materials when making the panels. Professor Majewski claims landfill bans are a useful tool, but they must be accompanied by legislation that guarantees waste is not simply shifted to other locations with less stringent regulations. Serial numbers that can check the history of solar panels could also be used to track recycling and guarantee that they are discarded in an environmentally friendly manner. Several European nations have legislation in place for electric car manufacturers to ensure they are using materials that allow 85% of the car to be recycled at the end of their life. Something similar could be legislated for solar panels. When weatherproof polymers used in solar panels are incinerated, they emit toxic hydro fluorite gas. Exposure to the gas can cause severe irritability and burning of the eyes, as well as headaches, nausea, and pulmonary edema in severe cases, sometimes resulting in permanent damage.

Why does melting ice contribute to global warming?,"Melting ice contributes to global warming because white ice reflects the sun's rays, while the dark sea absorbs over ten times more solar energy, increasing heat and accelerating warming.",Melting ice contributes to global warming in a couple of ways.,"[""by the ice, which starts to melt. The more the ice melts, the warmer the temperature on Earth. The algae therefore play an important role in global warming, says Alexandre Anesio. In recent years, larger and larger areas of the ice have become stained by the algae, making the ice melt even faster. Alexandre Anesio has calculated that the algae are increasing the ice melt by about 20 per cent. The algae on the ice also existed before people kicked off global warming through industrialisation. However, climate change means spring arrives ever earlier to the Arctic and as a result the algae have a longer season to grow and spread. The algae spread a little more every year. When I travel to Greenland, I now see vast areas where the ice is completely dark because of the algae, he says. Alexandre Anesio and his colleagues are spending a lot of time on the black algae because they are trying to find out whether the algae growth can be slowed down in some way or another. The is a balance In most ecosystems a kind of equilibrium because the various organisms keep each other in check. So Alexandre Anesio wants to learn more about the relationship between the different microbes. The various microorganisms on the ice affect each other. Some leave nutrition that others live off. Small viral particles attack and consume bacteria. We believe that some of the fungal spores could eat the black algae. This is what we're looking for, he says. However, he stresses that, even if they do find a way to curb algae growth, this will not solve climate change. Although it could slow it down. Algae growth is a consequence of our releasing too many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And this is where the problem must be solved. We need to focus on slowing down our emissions. Algae is found virtually everywhere. In the sea, in lakes, on trees and rocks, and even as small spores in the air. Most algae are greenish. Like plants and trees, they are green because of chlorophyll. A molecule that enables them to photosynthesise. Because the algae live on the ice, they're bombarded with sunlight and radiation. To protect themselves, they produce a lot of black pigment. It's actually the same pigment as in black tea. The pigment forms a protective layer outside the algae and protects the chlorophyll molecules against the dangerous radiation, says Alexandre Anesio. When the pigment absorbs the sun's rays, it generates heat. This heat makes the ice around the algae melt. And this actually"", ""Utilizing artificial intelligence, scientists from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and the University of Copenhagen discovered that meltwater in tunnels beneath Greenlands ice sheet changes speed and, in some places, accelerates rapidly towards the ocean. This can boost melting, particularly in a warming climate, which is why the studys researchers believe it is important to monitor. Greenlands ice sheet is massive, accounting for nearly half of all fresh water in the northern hemisphere. However, rising global temperatures are causing it to melt and the worlds oceans to rise. As a result, the movement of the ice sheet is closely monitored. Scientists from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) and the University of Copenhagens Niels Bohr Institute carried out a study that shows how ice sheet movements appear to be closely associated with meltwater flow beneath the ice. The investigators used artificial intelligence to evaluate ice movements, which they can now categorize into four groups based on movement patterns. According to the researchers, this information has been missing. This adds to the understanding of why the velocity of ice at the same location can change over time, which is essential for developing more accurate climate models for, among other things, sea level rise. With the help of large amounts of satellite data and artificial intelligence, we can identify and map general seasonal fluctuations over large parts of the ice sheet's edge. Not just for one year, but for fluctuations over a number of years as well. Thus, our study provides an indirect look at processes beneath the ice and the connection with meltwater on a large scale. This connection is very important to understand in relation to the warming climate of the future, in which the amount of meltwater will increase. The research has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. When meltwater from the surface reaches the bottom of the ice sheet, it continues to flow mainly toward the ice sheets edge via melted channels. The researchers discovered that the shape of these channels, also known as subglacial drainage pathways, influences the movement of the ice above. If the channels, which act as a drainage system, are ineffective at diverting water away, the pressure at the bottom rises, reducing friction between the ice and the bottom. As a result, the ice is moving faster toward the ocean. If the drainage system is effective, the ice will"", ""bedrock. This topography makes it possible for specific flow dynamics to collapse the West Antarctic ice sheet. When the ice melts below a specific threshold, instability occurs because of rising ocean temperatures. The onset of self perpetuating feedback results in an acceleration of ice loss. The tipping point is projected to be a 15 C global temperature rise. If the ice sheet melts, it will raise the global sea level by approximately three meters. Atlantic warm water influx amplifies the loss of Barents Sea ice. The tipping point or an abrupt loss will reach 16 C. Loss of sea ice in the Barents Sea will considerably affect atmospheric circulation, European climate, and possibly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is like a conveyor belt. It transports warm water to the northern region and, after cooling it, brings it back to the southern area. This circulation mechanism will become slower as freshwater production from melting glaciers in northern latitudes rises. An increase in the global mean temperature of 4 C will tip the balance. This collapse will have serious consequences on precipitation and temperature patterns, including weakening of the monsoon in Africa and Asia, depletion of natural carbon sinks, and warming of the southern hemisphere. Coral reefs are endangered by various human activities, including direct damages, overfishing, ocean acidification and sedimentation. However, when ocean temperature crosses a particular threshold, coral reefs repel their symbiotic algae, resulting in coral bleaching and subsequent die off. The anticipated threshold for wide spread die off is 15 C. Subtropical and tropical coral reefs significantly impact the ocean's carbon cycles and food web and are vital to the lives of millions of people worldwide. Die off eliminates all of these ecological functions of coral reefs. Continued greenhouse gas emissions will worsen climate change. It is anticipated that future changes will include a warmer and more acidic ocean, a warmer atmosphere, sea level rise, and more drastic changes in precipitation patterns. The global climate is expected to continue warming for the rest of the century. The Earth is likely no longer in a safe climate state, as the temperature has exceeded the warming by approximately 1 C. Therefore, even the UN Paris Agreement's target of keeping global warming well below 2 C and preferably 15 C might fall short of mitigating severe climate"", ""over ten times as much solar energy, contributing to global warming. Furthermore, it can have an impact on ecosystems The sea ice is a base for many ecosystems. The algae we examined are food for fish, fish are food for birds, etc. How will the marine ecosystems be affected globally if the sea ice disappears? We don't know the answer yet. According to the Aarhus University investigators, the research can be perceived as good and bad news for the climate. The bad news is that we can see this happening very soon. The good news is that our data shows the trend is reversible and we can do something about it if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and set ambitious political goals. If we can keep temperatures stable or perhaps even make them fall, the sea ice would return to the area. Christof Pearce reinforces stating, The study is a wake up call, because we know that it will happen. This news is not making the situation more depressing, just more urgent.

Apparently, paradoxically, snow cover in a few regions in northern Eurasia has increased over the last 10 years. But snow is a form of water global warming raises the quantity of moisture in the air, and thus the quantity and probability of snow and rain. Comprehending where exactly the moisture originates, how it is generated, and how it has been transported south seems to be appropriate for improved predictions of extreme weather and the progress of the climate. Environmental Scientist Tomonori Sato from Hokkaido University and his team came up with a highly tagged moisture transport model that depends on the so called Japanese 55 year reanalysis dataset. It is a painstaking reanalysis of worldwide historical weather data over the span of the past 55 years. The group utilized this material to retain their model calibrated over really long time distances compared to the previously possible and, thus, able to provide new insights into the mechanism of moisture transport, especially over the immense landmasses of Siberia. A standard method to examine moisture transport is the tagged moisture transport model. This is a computer modeling method that tracks where hypothetical parts of atmospheric moisture form, how they have moved nearby, and where they precipitate as a result of the local climatic conditions. However, the computer models turn out to be immensely incorrect as the distance to the ocean tends to increase. Mainly, this makes quantitative predictions hard. Hence, such techniques have not been able to favorably describe the snowfall in northern Eurasia. The study outcomes, published in the journal npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, display that water evaporation caused by the Arctic Ocean has increased over the last 40 years. Also, the greatest variations have happened from the Barents and Kara Seas north of western Siberia, as well as over the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas north of eastern Siberia, between the month of October and December. During this time of year, the Arctic Ocean still continues to warm and the area not covered by ice seems to be still large.']",0.10619274999900555,0.10167181749623977,0.09634998532036519,0.08989398479458867,0.29268292682926833,0.25641025641025644,0.29268292682926833,0.7197817623711882
Does the Swedish government plan bans on new petrol and diesel cars?,yes,The context provided does not contain specific information about the Swedish government's plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars.,"[""'Plans to sell only zero emissions new cars in the EU from 2035 are gaining momentum after Germany said it will back the proposed clean car deadline. German environment minister Steffi Lemke announced the coalition government would support the EU Commissions plan to end the sale of new cars and vans with internal combustion engines from 2035. As the federal government, we all stand behind the Commissions current proposal for the Fit for 55 package, Lemke said. The CO2 fleet limit values cars and vans have proven their worth for more climate protection in transport. We therefore also support the proposal of the Commission for the CO2 fleet limit values all their design elements. Germany supports the end of internal combustion engines for cars and light commercial vehicles in the EU from 2035. She also ruled out any backing for a loophole that would allow cars running on e fuels to escape the target. Combustion engines operated with e fuels are only an option after 2035 outside of the CO2 fleet limit values, Lemke added. Attention now turns to the governments which have yet to say if theyll support the 2035 deadline, which T & E says is essential to ensure the last polluting cars are off European roads by 2050. In Italy, where road transport is responsible for 23% of national CO2 emissions, T & E said the 2035 deadline would give the auto industry investment certainty for its transition while citizens could free themselves from their dependence on fossil fuel transport. Veronica Aneris, director of T & E Italy, said The Italian government must now follow the path outlined by Germany, following up the support for the Commissions proposal already announced last December by the Interministerial Committee for Ecological Transition (CITE). The era of the combustion engine must be brought to an end without reservation, and we must roll up our sleeves to speed up the transition to the electrification of the vehicle fleet. In Spain, T & E highlighted the economic and climate reasons why the government should advance the EU deadline to 2035. Spain currently plans to do so no later than 2040 as established by the Climate Change Law, said Carlos Rico, policy officer at T & E Spain. But, as Europes second largest vehicle manufacturer, it should join Germanys leading position in getting the EU to end the sale of new vehicles powered by diesel, petrol, hybrids and gas or e fuel powered vehicles by 2035 at the latest. E fuels, which are chemically similar to petrol and"", ""fleet data from Mobility Sweden, and updates are only released annually. At the start of 2022, plugins (mostly PHEVs due to the history) had 6% share of the fleet 50% plugin share of new sales would correspond to around 275% fleet turnover, and 100% would correspond to around 55%, other things being equal. This could be lifted to 6% or higher if retirement of old ICE vehicles is accelerated. Either way, Swedens fleet should cross 50% plugin share in 2030 or 2031, and road fuel demand by that stage should be under 30% of pre transition norms. Swedens fleet transition lags Norway significantly, for a few reasons. Norway has already had many years of plugin sales above 10%, steadily accumulating fleet volume. Like most other European markets, Swedens significant plugin adoption (climbing above 10% of new sales) has come only in the past 2 years, from almost nothing previously, so the fleet share has much more work to do. Another factor is Norways habitual import of lightly used plugins from nearby markets (including many from Sweden!) These influences will settle down in the years ahead, but as a rule of thumb, we should expect Swedens fleet transition to be 3 to 4 years behind Norways. The one silver lining is that Swedens average vehicle age is about 7% younger than Norways, which means the background fleet turnover rate should be that little bit faster, other things being equal. Mobility Sweden is currently forecasting around 300,000 passenger vehicle sales this year, similar to the past two years. This could yet shrink if the political and economic situation in Europe doesnt improve. With high fuel prices, however, those folks who are able to buy new vehicles will be looking at plugins more than ever before. Regardless of what happens to overall auto volume therefore, plugin share will continue to increase this year, and we should expect over 70% to be touched in the final quarter.

This would represent a remarkable acceleration of the BEV transition, given that Sweden was arguably 6 years behind when crossing the 10% mark (2019 vs 2013). Lets see what happens. In the nearer term, the coming months will see Sweden staying above the 50% mark and Im confident in saying that December will comfortably see over 60% plugin share. In fact I think it will be closer to 70% share. What is your estimate on Swedens transition timeline? Please share your thoughts in the comments.

Diesels remained in the doldrums, seeing their fourth consecutive month under 15% share. The overall auto market saw just over 21,000 new registrations in November, down almost 30% from pre pandemic seasonal norms. Swedens most popular full electric vehicle in November was the Volkswagen ID4. Novembers combined plugin result of 543% comprised 260% full battery electrics (BEVs) and 283% plugin hybrids (PHEVs), an even share of duty that has continued over the past 6 months. Cumulative plugin share for 2021 now stands at 434% (up from 296% year on year). In a fast changing transition, the most recent data gives a better indication of on the ground consumer sentiment Swedens trailing 3 month plugin share now stands at 531% up from 364% year on year. All plugless powertrains combined (diesel, petrol, HEV, and other fuels) saw volume fall from 16,207 sales in November 2020 to just 9,628 last month, a year on year fall of over 40%. At this point, Swedens pathway on the transition to plugins is approximately 2 years behind the leader, Norway. Like the latter, we can expect Sweden to quickly head towards over 90% plugins, likely before the end of 2023. In fact, since BEVs are quickly increasing in relative value compared to the legacy technology, Swedens journey to over 90% may be even faster than Norways was. November saw the Volkswagen ID4 take the top spot for BEV sales, maintaining the position it has held over recent months. The Nissan Leaf and Polestar 2 put in stronger than usual performances in November, and the MG ZS put in a weaker performance, due to lack of incoming supply. The Kia EV6 is already doing well, almost matching its older and smaller sibling the Kia Niro, in its first month of volume supply. Its continued success will depend on available supply volumes (which will always trail demand). Likewise, though at a lower volume, the new Volvo C40 proved quite popular in its first month of volume deliveries in its home country. VW Group saw a total of 4,870 sales over the past 3 months, some 278% of Swedens BEV market. Hyundai Kia (2,712 units and 151%), and Tesla (2,314 units and 129%) are in the # 2 and # 3 spots, respectively. All are supply constrained currently, along with the BEVs from many other manufacturers, and its anyones guess which BEVs would be selling most without this constraint. I think"", ""latest 3 month rankings (above) as much more indicative of future success, than the full year rankings Swedens plugin incentive landscape has changed a couple of times over the course of 2022. Since the most dramatic recent (and out of the blue) change on November 8th, the current situation is that there are no longer any carrot incentives (the climate bonus ) for newly ordered plugin vehicles (neither PHEV nor BEV). Existing yet to be fulfilled orders that were placed before November 8th will be grandfathered in, and still get the prior bonus payment (up to roughly 4,000 per vehicle) once finally delivered and registered for road use. With long delivery times for BEVs, in many cases the actual registration of these early November 2022 orders may happen as late as autumn 2023. However, the stick side of the bonus malus policy remains in place, since new ICE vehicles are still subject to higher road tax for the first 3 years after registration, whereas EVs (now classified as vehicles with emissions below 30g of CO2/km) pay no road tax (for now at least). The amount of ICE road tax is linked to emissions rating (CO2/km), and can amount to thousands of euros per year for the most inefficient autos. This being the case, there is still effectively an economic policy incentive for consumers to avoid ICE vehicles, and instead choose the most efficient plugins (mostly BEVs), on top of the long term energy cost savings for consumers who drive plugins rather than ICE vehicles. We wont have a clear picture of how the cancellation of the bonus will shape continuing plugin demand until next summer/autumn. Swedens transition to plugins will doubtless continue over the long run, though there may be some short to mid term discontinuities. Perhaps by autumn 2023 even more affordable BEVs, like the BYD Dolphin, will be starting to be offered in the Swedish market, and be able to compete on overall value with ICE vehicles in their own right.

Where do the turbines used in Icelandic geothermal power plants come from?,Japan,Most of the turbines used in Icelandic geothermal power plants are made by Japanese companies.,"[""'Japan and Iceland have signed a joint statement for geothermal energy cooperation following an official visit of the Japanese Minister Nishimura Yasutoshi to Reykjavik. On April 30th, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan HE. Mr. Nishimura Yasutoshi met with Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate of Iceland HE. Mr. Gudlaugur Thr Thrdarson in Reykjavk to discuss the global energy situation and possibility of bilateral cooperation of renewable energy. Minister Nishimura mentioned that most geothermal power plants in Iceland use turbines made by Japanese companies. For his part, Minister Thrdarson mentioned how geothermal energy is used in Iceland in various ways, including for both district heating and power generation. Both ministers took note of the high potential of geothermal energy in both countries. To promote concrete cooperation, the ministers signed a joint statement on geothermal energy cooperation and decided to organize a working group to exchange information and expertise on geothermal energy between the two countries. A visit to Hellisheidi The Japanese delegation, led by Minister Nishimura, also visited the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant and met with Svar Freyr Thrinsson, CEO of Reykjavik Energy, the parent company of ON Power and Carbfix. Edda Aradttir, CEO of Carbfix presented Carbfix s technology of CO2 mineralization and it s global scaling potential, followed by a presentation from Christoph Gebald, CEO of Climeworks. The guests of honor furthermore visited one of Carbfix s injection wells, where CO2 is being injected into the ground for permanent mineralization.

Our approach focuses primarily on constructing a detailed profile for the geothermal resource itself the more you know, the better your return on investment. These profiles allow us to provide tailored recommendations to support the business case, to create industry leading design concepts for the most efficient and productive geothermal power plants, and, finally, to ensure project stakeholders a smooth delivery during the detailed engineering design phase. We also support our customers in the construction phase, most recently in Nicaragua and the Philippines, and we are conducting preliminary resource assessment studies in Djibouti and Mozambique. Weve also seen a growing interest in how we combine our geochemical consultancy with custom brine pH modification systems to help our customers scale their operations. Cooperation is key for geothermal development. Steam contributes by actively engaging in Italian and European industry associations while also creating and hosting knowledge sharing programs in developing countries. We proud of our roots and we think that the knowledge base you can find in mature geothermal countries like Italy can help geothermal become a globally adopted energy solution, but we recognize that we have work to do to make geothermal an everyday topic.

Why is cannabis cultivation moving indoors?,"to meet the demand for higher-quality products, control environmental factors and flowering periods, and ensure consistent, year-round harvests",Cannabis cultivation is moving indoors due to several reasons.,"[""'Cannabis prohibition drove a culture of clandestine production in the past and solar helped growers to cultivate it at remote, off grid sites. Now, as a global commercial cannabis market emerges, solar has an even bigger role to play. Legal cannabis cultivation could be a big opportunity for solar. Solar energy and cannabis cultivation are old bedfellows. PV pioneer John Schaeffer has even credited solar with facilitating the northern California cannabis industry, which in turn supported the nascent PV sector. Now, as the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis gathers pace, solar continues to perform a key role. Cannabis cultivation can take place outdoors, indoors, or in greenhouses. While outdoor cultivation worked for millennia, the growth of the industry and increased demand for higher quality product plus tight profit margins have prompted producers to go indoors, where ideal environments can be replicated. Indoor growth gives control over environmental factors and flowering periods. More importantly, it means consistent, year round harvests. However, the high powered lights and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a Sasquatch sized carbon footprint. A 2022 report from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. UNODC estimated that the carbon footprint is 16 times to 100 times larger than for outdoor cultivation. Indoor factory farming is incompatible with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards, says Evan Mills, principal at engineering consultancy Energy Associates and a former senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mills spelled out the problem in a paper published in Energy Policy in 2012, the year Colorado and Washington state legalized cannabis and spurred a domino effect elsewhere. Even then, he estimated indoor cultivation accounted for 1% of total US electricity use, for a carbon footprint equivalent to three million cars. The scientist estimated 42% of cultivators grew exclusively indoors by 2020, often in multiple sprawling, Walmart scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately, installing large scale solar on site isnt an easy solution. According to Mills' recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe, California, the amount"", ""often in multiple sprawling, Walmart scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately, installing large scale solar on site isnt an easy solution. According to Mills' recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe, California, the amount of solar needed to achieve net zero energy supply would cover 1,400 acres far more land than would be necessary if the cannabis were grown outdoors. While entirely valid, Mills' research suggests an erroneous equivalency between indoor and outdoor grown cannabis. After all, anyone can brew up a big batch of moonshine in a bathtub but its not so easy to produce a fine single malt Scotch at scale. Indoor cannabis is a premium product and in a state like California, where people can still easily access a black market at least double the size of the regulated (and taxable) industry, commercial cannabis companies are incentivized to produce premium products only cultivable in a climate controlled environment. Large scale outdoor farming is also fraught with risk. In October, or Croptober as it is known, all of Californias outdoor grown cannabis is harvested. This single harvest, if it has not been spoiled by environmental impacts such as wildfires, is only attractive for consumers for several months. If the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other nine months of the year, well, theyll turn to an indoor site or greenhouse. Despite the alarming energy intensity of indoor cultivation, the sheer roofspace of grow houses is an ideal solar platform. California based Canndescent boasts more than 100,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and annually produces almost 17 tons of cannabis. In 2019, Canndescent installed a 2825 kW solar system at its facility in Desert Hot Springs. Canndescent Senior Director of Compliance Andrew Mochulsky tells PV Magazine the Colorado Deserts unrelenting sunshine and limited cloud cover make solar a no brainer. Were in the heart of solar and wind country so it made sense to bring solar online, he says. We also think its just the right thing to do. Indoor cultivation, Mochulsky says, is not trying to replace the sun but improve upon it to create rigid 12 hour midday sun conditions which are physically impossible outside. Because of that you have to control the environment so its very thirsty for electricity. Canndescents solar offsets 25% to 35% of the companys electricity consumption, according to Mochulsky, depending on"", 'upon it to create rigid 12 hour midday sun conditions which are physically impossible outside. Because of that you have to control the environment so its very thirsty for electricity. Canndescents solar offsets 25% to 35% of the companys electricity consumption, according to Mochulsky, depending on the time of year. Its a great investment, he adds. And if we can get closer to a 11 ratio of canopy space, it would have a substantial impact on our power costs. The inclusion of solar shades and carports also provides a quality of life benefit for employees, Mochulsky says. So people have a nice, shaded place to sit. Despite such benefits, only a small minority of North American indoor growers have gone solar. We are an outlier, says Mochulsky. I can not say that it is the norm. Even here in Desert Hot Springs we are the only one, and that is in sharp contrast to the residential market where every rooftop has solar on it. Solar makes abundant sense but it entails a cost upfront. The Canndescent director says tight cannabis margins are a factor. Even with an ROI return on investment, for solar of five years, the market is soft, costs are low except to operate and the liquidity is very tight. While cannabis legalization in the US is progressing state by state, and president Joe Biden has directed his secretary of health and human services, and the attorney general, to review cannabis scheduling under federal law, the market remains in legal limbo at national level, making financing solar difficult. There are a lot of prevailing headwinds for cannabis to adopt more solar, says Mochulsky. Access to a lot of financial instruments is just not available. We can not get a standard loan from the standard banks. We cant, for example, mortgage a company. Cannabis companies dont have availability to things like bankruptcy. Federal illegality also means we dont have access to state and federal tax credit programs such as the Inflation Reduction Act. Investors are much more attuned to that degree of risk. After all, if a company cant restructure, it has to fail. There are more examples of solar adoption, however. Much further north, Freedom Cannabis tapped AltaPro Electric to design and install a 183 MW system atop its facility in Acheson, Alberta, in 2020. Its Canadas largest operational rooftop PV installation, says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin. Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. The margins in the indoor grow operations are', ""optimizing, energy producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses. UbiGros translucent greenhouse film is integrated with photoluminescent particles that convert light into a preferable wavelength and can easily be combined with a solar module. UbiQD founder and CEO Hunter McDaniel tells PV Magazine that if the panels only partially shade the greenhouse, the yield lost to shading can be made up by the spectrum improvement provided by the film. McDaniel adds that while indoor growers have thus far managed to keep the scope of their energy intensity quiet as opposed to similarly emergent energy intensive industries such as crypto mining indoor growth is likely to shrink. Scientist Mills' research supports this idea, as the number of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80% to 60% between 2016 and 2020. With outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking, the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future. The cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in US states where the plant has been legalized more recently, such as New York. Nate VerHague, market development manager at New York based installer Solar Liberty, tells PV Magazine the new cannabis market is going to have a ton of potential for solar. VerHague notes cannabis operations in New York state (NYS) are only just getting up and running. There is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations, he says. It is an ideal customer for solar, as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize. While the nascent nature of the NYS market means Solar Liberty is yet to install PV for a cannabis company, VerHague confirms the installer is in the quoting process with some organizations, with the market looking promising from this year onward. National and regional governments the world over are shaping to follow in the footsteps of the US, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Uruguay, and others. Germany could legalize cannabis completely within a few years, a development which would not only make it the worlds single largest legal market but also, considering its European centrality, the worlds dankest domino, as neighbors would be expected to follow. Cannabis is becoming big business and, given its energy needs, could be big business for solar too"", 'and install a 183 MW system atop its facility in Acheson, Alberta, in 2020. Its Canadas largest operational rooftop PV installation, says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin. Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. The margins in the indoor grow operations are very competitive and chopping down one of the largest opex operating expenditure items is a great way that Freedom Cannabis has been able to be a leader in the industry, DeBruin tells PV Magazine. He says other cannabis companies have made inquiries about solar but, as in the US, it seems the clients are held back due to financing becoming harder to attain from lenders. Its too bad because the cost of borrowing is dwarfed by the savings many times, making any loan to install solar cash flow positive in year one. Cannabis is not limited to medical and recreational use. Hemp is one of the most versatile crops on the planet and its making a big comeback. As hemp is not grown for psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its farming is far less intensive and finicky than, for example, the high THC flower grown by Canndescent in California. This makes hemp a potentially ideal agrivoltaic crop. In Melz, Germany, agrivoltaic developer SunFarming is currently trialing the cultivation of hemp under solar panels. All the plants, without exception, have grown well and developed excellently, says Rafael Dulon, founder and managing director of Hanf Farm. Dulon says the panels also help with mold, a key concern for hemp farmers. Mold becomes a problem in autumn as temperatures cool and precipitation on the plants fails to dry. The rain protection for the plants provided by the PV system works wonderfully, Dulon says. Another less energy intensive growing option is a greenhouse. However, the need for natural sunlight makes rooftop solar less attractive on such structures. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are improving rapidly but products such as solar facades for greenhouses may be years away. In the meantime, US based nanomaterials innovator UbiQDs agricultural arm, UbiGro and solar panel manufacturer Heliene have entered a joint development agreement for light optimizing, energy producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses.

Even here in Desert Hot Springs we are the only one, and that is in sharp contrast to the residential market where every rooftop has solar on it. Solar makes abundant sense but it entails a cost upfront. The Canndescent director says tight cannabis margins are a factor. Even with an ROI return on investment, for solar of five years, the market is soft, costs are low except to operate and the liquidity is very tight. While cannabis legalization in the US is progressing state by state, and president Joe Biden has directed his secretary of health and human services, and the attorney general, to review cannabis scheduling under federal law, the market remains in legal limbo at national level, making financing solar difficult. There are a lot of prevailing headwinds for cannabis to adopt more solar, says Mochulsky. Access to a lot of financial instruments is just not available. We can not get a standard loan from the standard banks. We cant, for example, mortgage a company. Cannabis companies dont have availability to things like bankruptcy. Federal illegality also means we dont have access to state and federal tax credit programs such as the Inflation Reduction Act. Investors are much more attuned to that degree of risk. After all, if a company cant restructure, it has to fail. There are more examples of solar adoption, however. Much further north, Freedom Cannabis tapped AltaPro Electric to design and install a 183 MW system atop its facility in Acheson, Alberta, in 2020. Its Canadas largest operational rooftop PV installation, says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin. Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. The margins in the indoor grow operations are', ""often in multiple sprawling, Walmart scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately, installing large scale solar on site isnt an easy solution. According to Mills' recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe, California, the amount of solar needed to achieve net zero energy supply would cover 1,400 acres far more land than would be necessary if the cannabis were grown outdoors. While entirely valid, Mills' research suggests an erroneous equivalency between indoor and outdoor grown cannabis. After all, anyone can brew up a big batch of moonshine in a bathtub but its not so easy to produce a fine single malt Scotch at scale. Indoor cannabis is a premium product and in a state like California, where people can still easily access a black market at least double the size of the regulated (and taxable) industry, commercial cannabis companies are incentivized to produce premium products only cultivable in a climate controlled environment. Large scale outdoor farming is also fraught with risk. In October, or Croptober as it is known, all of Californias outdoor grown cannabis is harvested. This single harvest, if it has not been spoiled by environmental impacts such as wildfires, is only attractive for consumers for several months. If the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other nine months of the year, well, theyll turn to an indoor site or greenhouse. Despite the alarming energy intensity of indoor cultivation, the sheer roofspace of grow houses is an ideal solar platform. California based Canndescent boasts more than 100,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and annually produces almost 17 tons of cannabis. In 2019, Canndescent installed a 2825 kW solar system at its facility in Desert Hot Springs. Canndescent Senior Director of Compliance Andrew Mochulsky tells PV Magazine the Colorado Deserts unrelenting sunshine and limited cloud cover make solar a no brainer. Were in the heart of solar and wind country so it made sense to bring solar online, he says. We also think its just the right thing to do. Indoor cultivation, Mochulsky says, is not trying to replace the sun but improve upon it to create rigid 12 hour midday sun conditions which are physically impossible outside. Because of that you have to control the environment so its very thirsty for electricity. Canndescents solar offsets 25% to 35% of the companys electricity consumption, according to Mochulsky, depending on"", 'and install a 183 MW system atop its facility in Acheson, Alberta, in 2020. Its Canadas largest operational rooftop PV installation, says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin. Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. The margins in the indoor grow operations are very competitive and chopping down one of the largest opex operating expenditure items is a great way that Freedom Cannabis has been able to be a leader in the industry, DeBruin tells PV Magazine. He says other cannabis companies have made inquiries about solar but, as in the US, it seems the clients are held back due to financing becoming harder to attain from lenders. Its too bad because the cost of borrowing is dwarfed by the savings many times, making any loan to install solar cash flow positive in year one. Cannabis is not limited to medical and recreational use. Hemp is one of the most versatile crops on the planet and its making a big comeback. As hemp is not grown for psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its farming is far less intensive and finicky than, for example, the high THC flower grown by Canndescent in California. This makes hemp a potentially ideal agrivoltaic crop. In Melz, Germany, agrivoltaic developer SunFarming is currently trialing the cultivation of hemp under solar panels. All the plants, without exception, have grown well and developed excellently, says Rafael Dulon, founder and managing director of Hanf Farm. Dulon says the panels also help with mold, a key concern for hemp farmers. Mold becomes a problem in autumn as temperatures cool and precipitation on the plants fails to dry. The rain protection for the plants provided by the PV system works wonderfully, Dulon says. Another less energy intensive growing option is a greenhouse. However, the need for natural sunlight makes rooftop solar less attractive on such structures. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are improving rapidly but products such as solar facades for greenhouses may be years away. In the meantime, US based nanomaterials innovator UbiQDs agricultural arm, UbiGro and solar panel manufacturer Heliene have entered a joint development agreement for light optimizing, energy producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses. UbiGros translucent greenhouse film is integrated with photoluminescent particles that convert light into a preferable wavelength and can easily be combined with a solar module. UbiQD founder and CEO Hunter McDaniel tells PV', ""optimizing, energy producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses. UbiGros translucent greenhouse film is integrated with photoluminescent particles that convert light into a preferable wavelength and can easily be combined with a solar module. UbiQD founder and CEO Hunter McDaniel tells PV Magazine that if the panels only partially shade the greenhouse, the yield lost to shading can be made up by the spectrum improvement provided by the film. McDaniel adds that while indoor growers have thus far managed to keep the scope of their energy intensity quiet as opposed to similarly emergent energy intensive industries such as crypto mining indoor growth is likely to shrink. Scientist Mills' research supports this idea, as the number of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80% to 60% between 2016 and 2020. With outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking, the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future. The cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in US states where the plant has been legalized more recently, such as New York. Nate VerHague, market development manager at New York based installer Solar Liberty, tells PV Magazine the new cannabis market is going to have a ton of potential for solar. VerHague notes cannabis operations in New York state (NYS) are only just getting up and running. There is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations, he says. It is an ideal customer for solar, as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize. While the nascent nature of the NYS market means Solar Liberty is yet to install PV for a cannabis company, VerHague confirms the installer is in the quoting process with some organizations, with the market looking promising from this year onward. National and regional governments the world over are shaping to follow in the footsteps of the US, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Uruguay, and others. Germany could legalize cannabis completely within a few years, a development which would not only make it the worlds single largest legal market but also, considering its European centrality, the worlds dankest domino, as neighbors would be expected to follow. Cannabis is becoming big business and, given its energy needs, could be big business for solar too""]",0.021463884769178394,0.0070257054758978395,0.004963012528221607,0.004255627571063961,0.04081632653061225,0.0,0.04081632653061225,0.474529130019702
"In 2021, what were the top 3 states in the US in terms of total solar power generating capacity?","California, Texas, and Florida","In 2021, the top three states in the US for total solar power generating capacity were California, Texas, and Florida.","[""'As of December 2020, the states with the most small scale solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity were California (106 gigawatts (GW)), New Jersey (19 GW), and Massachusetts (18 GW). Of the 45 GW of small scale solar capacity added in the United States in 2020, California accounted for 31%, the largest share by far. Although Texas and Florida have less total small scale solar capacity than states such as California or New Jersey, capacity has grown rapidly in these states in recent years. In 2020, Texas added 422 megawatts (MW) of small scale solar, and Florida added 282 MW. State incentives, strong solar resources, and policy changes are largely driving these gains. New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are among the leading states for small scale solar capacity despite having less favorable solar resources. In these states, long standing state policies such as renewable and clean energy standards and other incentives, some of which include specific provisions for solar, have encouraged small scale solar capacity growth. In 2020, small scale solar capacity in Texas grew by 63%, increasing from 670 MW in 2019 to 1,093 MW. Texas does not require utility companies to purchase excess energy from residential solar panels. As such, net metering, which allows customers who generate their own electricity to sell excess electricity back to the grid, is not available to many homeowners in Texas. Although net metering is not widely available, some retail electricity companies in Texas offer a renewable buyback program in the form of bill credits. In addition, Texas offers a property tax exemption for the added home value from rooftop solar installations, encouraging small scale solar growth in the state. Removing restrictions on leased solar systems has encouraged small scale solar growth in Florida. Until April 2018, the Florida Public Service Commission restricted electricity sales from leased solar systems. Without the restriction, electricity customers can lease solar systems with little or no upfront costs, making solar PV more widely financially feasible and resulting in immense growth in residential solar PV installations across the state. In 2020, small scale solar capacity in Florida grew 57%, increasing from 492 MW in 2019 to 773 MW. Although not in the top states for total small scale solar capacity, Illinois added 309 MW of small scale solar capacity in 2020, the third highest number of additions that year. These additions doubled small scale solar capacity"", 'In 2021, Colorado installed the 12th most capacity in the US, before falling to 26th in 2022 and rebounding to fourth in the country in the first half of this year. Much of this growth has been driven by Lighstource bp beginning operations at its 283MW Sun Mountain project in the state in February, and with Meyer Burger planning to build a 2GW cell manufacturing plant in Colorado, the state could be set for sustained growth in the solar sector. Conversely, Indiana has fallen down the rankings of the 50 states, plus the territory of Puerto Rico and the city of Washington DC. In 2021, the state installed the seventh most solar capacity, which fell to 18th most in 2022 and 40th most in the first half of this year. Some of this growth can also be traced back to the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has sought to develop a domestic supply chain for the US solar sector. While the passing of the act initially created concern as to how the sector could continue growth without imported Chinese modules, many US manufacturers have since invested in and commissioned cell and module factories within the US. The report also notes that, in the wake of the passing of the IRA, separate forms of legislation have come into effect to further encourage domestic manufacturing. The Withhold Release Order and Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act have both raised barriers to importing the quantity of modules from China as the US once did, pushing more companies towards domestic manufacturing. The results of these supply chain disruptions is clear. According to the report, module manufacturers have announced approximately three dozen capacity additions, which could dramatically increase the module manufacturing capacity of the US and Puerto Rico from 106GW today to 1085GW by 2026. The United States is now a dominant player in the global clean energy economy, and states like Florida, Texas, Ohio, and Georgia are at the forefront of this job growth and economic prosperity, said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. The solar and storage industry is delivering abundant clean energy that is generating tens of billions of dollars of private investment, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. However, the disruptions to such an established supply chain as the China to US solar module trade have negatively impacted the US sector. The report estimates that the global average selling price for PV modules has decreased by US $ 001 003 per watt in the last six months,', ""'Here are the brand new stats and forecasts from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Despite all the challenges of 2020, the United States solar industry broke several records. The United States Solar Market Insight 2020 Year in Review report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, found that the industry installed a record 192 GW of capacity last year. That was a 43% increase from 2019 and bested the markets previous annual record of 151 GW set in 2016. California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states for annual solar capacity additions for the second straight year. In 2020, 27 states installed over 100 MW of new solar capacity, a record (Like our solar coverage? Subscribe to our free daily newsletter) Annual residential solar deployment rose 11% from 2019, reaching a record 31 GW. However, the report said this was lower than the 18% annual growth in 2019, as residential installations were impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. Annual non residential installations fell 4% from 2019, with 2 GW installed in 2020. The report said the pandemic impacted this segment, too, through delayed project interconnections and prolonged development timelines. For the second year in a row, solar led all technologies in new United States electric generating capacity added, accounting for 43% in 2020. The United States solar industry also saw its biggest quarterly gain ever in the fourth quarter, adding 8 GW of new capacity. For perspective, the market added 75 GW of capacity in all of 2015. The report said there was a historic 63 GW of utility scale projects installed in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual total just shy of 14 GW. The report said that 5 GW of new utility solar power purchase agreements were announced during the quarter. That brought the volume of project announcements in 2020 to 306 GW and the full utility scale contracted pipeline to 69 GW. For the first time, Wood Mackenzie also released a long term forecast as part of the United States Solar Market Insight report series. By 2030, it expects that the total operating United States solar fleet will more than quadruple, installing a cumulative 324 GW of new capacity to reach a total of 419 GW. Michelle Davis, senior analyst from Wood Mackenzie, said the two year extension of the investment tax credit at the end of 2020 will drive greater solar adoption and led to a 17% increase in deployment in the reports 2021"", ""ahead of the industry, our high and low case scenarios can help the industry benchmark potential outcomes. In each scenario, there is roughly 20 GW of upside or downside risk over the next five years the same amount of capacity installed last year. The residential solar market experienced a 40% increase in installed solar capacity in 2022, and now 6% of all homes in the United States have solar. By 2030, that number is expected to grow to 15%. In 2022, 783 MW of new residential, commercial and community solar capacity deployed was paired with energy storage systems, a new record. By 2027, 33% of new residential solar capacity and 20% of new commercial and community solar capacity will be paired with storage. California, Texas, and Florida were the Top 3 states for new solar capacity additions for the third consecutive year, with California taking back the top spot after Texas led the nation in 2021. Even as supply chain constraints slowed the market, solar accounted for 50% of all new electric generating capacity additions in 2022. Today, solar accounts for nearly 5% of United States electricity generation.

Supply chain challenges abating and delayed solar projects resuming largely drove the record quarter. Due in part to the strong first quarter numbers and a surge in demand resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Wood Mackenzie expects the solar market to triple in size over the next five years, bringing total installed solar capacity to 378 GW by 2028. The IRA has also prompted a surge of new manufacturing announcements, with domestic module capacity expected to rise from fewer than 9 GW currently to more than 60 GW by 2026. At least 16 GW of module manufacturing facilities were under construction as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. This quarter, the Biden administration provided some clarity on how the IRAs adder credits will be applied. The landmark law contains new credits that can be used in conjunction with the solar Investment Tax Credit, like the domestic content, energy communities, and low income adder credits. In particular, the energy communities and low income adder guidance will help drive solar and storage investment in underserved communities. Despite rising interest rates and economic headwinds causing customer hesitancy, the residential segment installed 16 GW of solar capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 30% increase from the first quarter of 2022. The residential market segment is on track to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, growing at an average annual rate of 6%. The commercial market also had a record first quarter, with 391 MW installed, putting the segment on track for 12% growth in 2023. Meanwhile, the community solar segment installed 212 MW, a 13% decrease from the first quarter of 2022 due in large part to ongoing interconnection challenges. The utility scale market rebounded from a difficult 2022 with a strong first quarter and a record 38 GW of installed solar capacity. By far, Florida was the top solar state in the first quarter of 2023 thanks to 146 GW of utility scale solar installations. Florida installed over 70% more solar capacity in the first quarter than the next highest state, California.

Which has the higher absorption coefficient for wavelengths above 500m - amorphous germanium or amorphous silicon?,amorphous germanium,Amorphous germanium has a higher absorption coefficient for wavelengths above 500 nm compared to amorphous silicon.,"[""'German scientists have fabricated an enhanced amorphous germanium PV cell that confines light in an ultra thin absorber. It has the potential to combine PV with photosynthesis in new solar applications on bio reactors, greenhouses, and agricultural land. Researchers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) have developed a selective solar cell based on an ultra thin n i p absorber layer stack and a thin film spectral selective filter. They claim it can be used to produce spectrally selective PV modules with potential applications in agrivoltaics, greenhouses, and photo bioreactors. They presented their findings in Spectral engineering of ultra thin germanium solar cells for combined photovoltaic and photosynthesis, which was recently published in Optics Express. The device is an enhanced amorphous germanium (a Ge H) solar cell that can confine light in an ultra thin absorber. Due to the strong optical confinement and the high absorption coefficient of a Ge H the absorber thickness can be reduced to 5 10 nm while still achieving an efficiency of 5% for an opaque solar cell, the academics said. We chose amorphous germanium instead of amorphous silicon as absorber material because of its higher absorption coefficient for wavelengths above 500 nm. The technology only relies on plasma enhanced vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, which are well established, industry proven thin film deposition methods, the group said. At the moment we prepare a project, in which the spectrally selective solar cells will be scaled up to small module size, researcher Norbert Osterthun told PV Magazine. These modules will then be tested in greenhouse environments in Almeria and Oldenburg, representing the conditions of two very relevant regions for greenhouse cultivation in Europe. The spectrally selective cell uses the so called green gap and the infrared (IR) part of the spectrum, which are not used by plants for photosynthesis. Our cell only absorbs green and infra red spectral part of the sun light, while transmitting blue and red light that is absorbed in the process of photosynthesis by chlorophyll, Osterthun added. The research group built the cell with a transparent conductive metal oxide metal oxide (MOMO) multilayer. The nature of the MOMO allows for the dual use as an optical filter and as an electrical contact, Osterthun said, noting that it is based on a Fabry Perot resonator, which is the most basic optical resonator known for its color filtering properties. The"", 'absorption coefficient that is claimed to be 5 10 times greater than any other material currently used for PV technology, across a wide spectral range from 400 to 1,000nm. With the high absorption coefficient of our films, an ultra thin layer of AgBiS2 NCs would be sufficient to absorb most of the light in the visible range, they stated. The researchers engineered the layer of nanocrystals in the cell with an unconventional approach described as cation disorder engineering, through which they tuned the atomic positions of the cations within the lattice of AgBiS2 nanocrystals to trigger a cation inter site exchange and achieve a homogenous cation distribution. Mercaptopropionic acid was used as a passivating ligand to preserve the material quality upon annealing. Our theoretical investigations of the thermodynamics and optical/electronic effects of cation disorder in AgBiS2 revealed both the accessibility of cation re distribution and the strong impact of this on the optoelectronic properties, said research co author Sen Kavanagh. Our calculations revealed that a homogeneous cation distribution would yield optimal solar cell performance in these disordered materials, corroborating the experimental discoveries as a testament of the synergism between theory and experiment. The solar cell was built with AgBiS2 nanocrystals that were deposited layer by layer onto a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO). It was then coated with a solution based on poly (triaryl) amine (PTAA), which is an excellent hole transporting and electron blocking material. Tested under standard illumination conditions the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 917%, an open circuit voltage of 0495V, a short circuit current of 2675mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 63%. It is really exciting to see that 30nm device gives such a high short circuit current density up to 27mA/cm2 and an efficiency up to 9%, said research co author Yongjie Wang. After grasping control of the process and optimization of the full stack, including optimizing electron and hole transport layers, we finally found a highly reproducible structure for efficient solar cells with improved stability. According to Konstantatos, the proposed manufacturing process is compatible with roll to roll techniques like those used for organic and perovskite cells and may be immediately reproducible on an industrial scale. The cost related to the absorbers is only a fraction of the cost of the cell, he told PV', ""'A Chinese German research group developed the cell with an ink of graphene oxide (GO) mixed with Nafion that can be spin coated on an n type silicon wafer to form a high quality passivating contact scheme.

The solar cell was built with AgBiS2 nanocrystals that were deposited layer by layer onto a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO). Silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2) nanocrystals (NCs) are an earth abundant material that has been used in recent years as a promising PV material, often in combination with cadmium sulfide in the development of several kinds of ultra thin solar cells. Solar cells built with these nanocrystals have so far reached efficiencies of up to 6% and their optoelectronic overall properties have been found to change drastically as their composition and size are changed. Their fabrication can be performed in air at low temperatures using low cost solution processing techniques and inexpensive production equipment. Furthermore, AgBiS2 NCs have very low toxicity compared to other materials used for thin film solar cells, such as cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide itself. With this in mind, a group of researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain has developed an AgBiS2 PV device with potential applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), vehicle integrated solar, and internet of things (IoT) devices. Currently, this technology could have applications where environmental friendliness and compatibility with restrictions on hazardous substances is a big problem, like in consumer electronics, the research's corresponding author, Gerasimos Konstantatos, told PV Magazine. It could also find applications where form factor is an issue so, in cases where low weight and flexible PV are needed and, as the performance may improve, this technology could even outcompete crystalline silicon photovoltaics in large scale applications.
