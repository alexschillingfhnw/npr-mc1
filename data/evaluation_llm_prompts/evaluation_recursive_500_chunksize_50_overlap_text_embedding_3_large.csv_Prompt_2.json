These details are supported by the retrieved contexts, which mention the VPPA with Scout Clean Energy and the specifics of the Markum Solar Farm project. The faithfulness of the answer is also high, as it does not introduce any unsupported claims or hallucinate information. However, the mention of the VPPA being part of Colgate-Palmolive's renewable energy master plan is not explicitly supported by the retrieved contexts, which slightly affects the faithfulness score. Overall, the generated answer is well-aligned with the question and the provided information.\"\n}\n```",
