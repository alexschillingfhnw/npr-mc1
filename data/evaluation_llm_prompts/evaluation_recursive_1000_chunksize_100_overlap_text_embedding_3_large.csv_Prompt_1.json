        "response": "Leclanch\u00e9 has developed an environmentally friendly method to produce lithium-ion batteries. The innovation lies in replacing the highly toxic organic solvents, which are commonly used in the production process, with a water-based process to make nickel manganese cobalt aluminium cathodes (NMCA). Organic solvents, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), are harmful to the environment and have been restricted by the European Commission. The water-based process is not only safer, eliminating the risk of explosion, but also reduces the carbon footprint by using 30% less energy. Additionally, Leclanch\u00e9 has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90% in its new G/NMCA battery, which increases the energy density",

Leclanch claims to be a global pioneer in the field, having used aqueous binders in its for over a decade. A further benefit of the water based process is a lower carbon footprint, as it uses 30% less energy, which would otherwise be needed to dry, or evaporate, and recycle the solvents. With the water based production of the high capacity NMCA cathodes, we have reached a decisive milestone in lithium ion technology, said Dr Hilmi Buqa, vice president R & D at Leclanch. Until now, producing them using environmentally friendly processes was considered impossible. But, now we have mastered the process. In developing its new G/NMCA battery, Leclanch has increased the nickel content of the cathode to around 90%, which has the effect of increasing the energy density. The Grefers to the graphite anode. Increasing the nickel content allows for the cobalt content to be reduced",

Full battery cells fabricated using the anodes maintained 85% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles. The group says it plans to continue working on this approach, which could offer a simplified solution to integrating lithium metal into energy storage. We believe that our advanced strategy, which is different to previously reported technologies, such as adding novel and toxic additives in electrolytes and surface morphology modification using complicated methods, will enable the realization of a highly stable LMA with outstanding electrochemical performance for application in the practical energy storage fields to replace conventional LiBs, the group concluded",

The I State cells use an entirely new battery technology based on an innovative liquid inorganic electrolyte that can operate at higher voltages than traditional Li ion battery cells, they add. The higher voltage of the cells enables higher utilization of cathode capacity through usage of nearly 100% of available Lithium vs 80% for Li ion, over many stable cycles, and at high charge and discharge rates, they add. Due to the improved efficiency of the cathode, the I State battery reduces the amount of lithium and other expensive metals needed in the cell. That provides for multiple benefits. The 20% reduction of lithium, cobalt and nickel will help alleviate environmental and sourcing concerns, while typically reducing the weight of an EV battery pack by",

            "was also hammering away at the challenge of introducing fuel cell vehicles to the US market. The collaboration launched in July of 2013, providing for the two companies to share the combined total of 1,200 fuel cell patents they compiled in the years leading up to 2012. GM introduced its SURUS fuel cell electric vehicle platform in 2017, but it still didnt have a fuel cell EV in commercial production by 2020, though a preliminary agreement with Nikola Motor involving the Badger fuel cell electric pickup truck suggested that activity was about to pick up. Unfortunately for FCEV fans, Nikola fell on its face following a scandal involving former CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola has since recovered itself, but the relationship with GM foundered. GM has not been idling around since then. As part of its collaboration with Honda, GM set its sights on developing fuel cells for heavy duty use, resulting in its Hydrotec suite of fuel cell systems. In 2021 GM launched a hydrogen powered flight",
            "venture in the field of fuel cell aircraft. Last fall GM also came roaring back into the fuel cell fold with a focus on green hydrogen for its fuel cells. Coincidentally or not, last fall Honda reaffirmed its plans to produce an all electric version of its popular CR V crossover SUV with a battery pack and a fuel cell range extender (here is additional coverage). That was certainly not a coincidence. Though Honda snared much of the media spotlight with its CR V announcement, last week the company issued a press release that underscored its collaboration with GM. Since 2013, Honda has been working with GM on the joint development of the next generation fuel cell system, Honda explained, confirming that it plans to launch a new fuel cell electric car in 2024, equipped with the next generation fuel cell system jointly developed with GM. This next generation fuel cell system, which leverages the knowledge, know how and economies of scale of both companies, will reduce the cost to one",
            "also stated that it has further cost cutting strategies in hand. The company foresees another 50% reduction in costs in the coming years, on top of the 33% reduction achieved with GM. In an interesting twist, Honda seemed to indicate that its fuel cell collaboration with GM is coming to a close, at least in its present form. Honda has begun fundamental research on future fuel cell technologies with targets to halve the cost and double the durability compared to the fuel cell system co developed with GM, the company stated. That language suggests Honda is branching off to develop its own technology, if not dropping the relationship entirely. If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, GM may have something up its sleeve as well. In 2016 the company delivered a mission ready fuel cell version of its Colorado pickup truck to the US Army for testing. In a 2018 recap of the program, the Army noted that it has leveraged more than $ 3 billion in GM",
            "has also introduced a van that incorporates batteries. As for the Chevrolet brands parent company, General Motors, thats where things get interesting. Back in 2012, GM partnered with the US Army to demonstrate a fleet of 16 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which were modified versions of the Chevy Equinox crossover SUV. If you think car when you spot an SUV, then GM put a fleet of 16 fuel cell cars on the road. The next year, GM and Honda announced a fuel cell collaboration. Honda also signed on to an Obama era program to build a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure, and in 2017 the two companies announced their intention to build a fuel cell factory in Ohio. In 2018, GM reaffirmed its commitment to include fuel cell vehicles in its lineup by 2020, but the year came and went with no fuel cell electric car in sight. However, GM was still moving forward behind the scenes, including a new venture in the field of fuel cell aircraft. Last fall GM also came roaring back into the fuel cell",
            "the knowledge, know how and economies of scale of both companies, will reduce the cost to one third compared to the cost of the fuel cell system in the 2019 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell, Honda stated. If you caught that thing about the Clarity, thats significant because the Clarity was an electric sedan, not an SUV. Honda introduced the car in 2017, but discontinued it within just a few years, including an all battery version as well as fuel cell and hybrid versions. Clearly the end of Clarity did not mean giving up the fuel cell dream. The collaboration with GM paid off on the cost cutting side, bringing fuel cell electric cars closer to parity with battery electric and gas powered cars. Honda listed innovative materials for electrodes, an enhanced cell sealing structure, streamlined supporting equipment, and productivity improvements among the elements leading to reduced costs. Honda also stated that it has further cost cutting strategies in hand. The company foresees another 50%"

And then you enjoy all the electricity they create. The cost of these solar power systems which include solar modules, inverters, and special brackets is just 41681 ($ 44883). That seems ridiculously low to me, but it is what it is. Reportedly, there is no need for a permit when using these solar panels (That may vary by jurisdiction) And the kit comes with everything needed to connect the panels to the fence.

This is what the company has to say about its garden fence solar PV Thanks to the vertical attachment of the modules to the property or garden fence, particularly high yields are achieved when the sun is low. This means that the fence system performs much better than a roof system, especially when a lot of energy is needed, ie in the morning and evening hours. The complete sets consist of PV modules, micro inverters, mounting material and come with everything you need for the installation. Even the tool. They can be flexibly attached to existing fences and thus optimally adapt to your needs. Before these garden fence solar PV systems, Green Akku was in the business of selling solar PV panels for balconies.

A US Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low cost racking solution for solar modules. This is perhaps the lowest cost approach to racking, the research's corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told PV Magazine. What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free.

In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts.

These darker surfaces absorb more of the sun's heat, rather than reflecting it, which leads to an increase in temperature.

In recent years, larger and larger areas of the ice have become stained by the algae, making the ice melt even faster.

Charging on the move suits most people, but not everyone. This is shown by a new study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, where for the first time researchers combine the so called electric road system with real life driving patterns of Swedish drivers. The Swedish government has proposed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The same trends are seen across Europe, as demonstrated by the rapid increasing sales of electric vehicles. As this development progresses, challenges are also increasing, including the uneven load on the power grid and where to charge the electric vehicles. Several countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, are testing whether electric road system (ERS) can be used to electrify road networks. An ERS charges moving vehicles with either",

All plugless powertrains combined (diesel, petrol, HEV, and other fuels) saw volume fall from 16,207 sales in November 2020 to just 9,628 last month, a year on year fall of over 40%. At this point, Swedens pathway on the transition to plugins is approximately 2 years behind the leader, Norway. Like the latter, we can expect Sweden to quickly head towards over 90% plugins, likely before the end of 2023. In fact, since BEVs are quickly increasing in relative value compared to the legacy technology, Swedens journey to over 90% may be even faster than Norways was. November saw the Volkswagen ID4 take the top spot for BEV sales, maintaining the position it has held over recent months. The Nissan Leaf and Polestar 2 put in stronger than usual performances in November, and the MG ZS put in a weaker performance, due to lack of incoming supply. The Kia EV6 is already doing well, almost matching its older and smaller sibling the Kia Niro, in its first month of volume supply. Its continued",

Since the most dramatic recent (and out of the blue) change on November 8th, the current situation is that there are no longer any carrot incentives (the climate bonus ) for newly ordered plugin vehicles (neither PHEV nor BEV). Existing yet to be fulfilled orders that were placed before November 8th will be grandfathered in, and still get the prior bonus payment (up to roughly 4,000 per vehicle) once finally delivered and registered for road use. With long delivery times for BEVs, in many cases the actual registration of these early November 2022 orders may happen as late as autumn 2023. However, the stick side of the bonus malus policy remains in place, since new ICE vehicles are still subject to higher road tax for the first 3 years after registration, whereas EVs (now classified as vehicles with emissions below 30g of CO2/km) pay no road tax (for now at least).

Agrivoltaics allow for this land to continue to farm, while also adding a new type of harvest solar energy. The most successful marriage of solar energy and agriculture comes from dual use, where part of the land is utilizing solar panels but key types of crops and livestock can readily coexist. This includes employing sheep to maintain the grass around the solar panels, growing pollinator friendly plants as groundcover and more.
