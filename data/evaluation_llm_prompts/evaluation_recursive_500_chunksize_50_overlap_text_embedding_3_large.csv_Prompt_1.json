Firstly, white ice reflects the sun's rays, but when it melts, the darker sea or land underneath absorbs over ten times as much solar energy, which raises temperatures and contributes to global warming. Secondly, algae that grow on melting ice can darken the ice, making it absorb more heat from the sun and melt faster, which further increases temperatures. This process is known as the albedo effect. Lastly, when ice caps that cover land masses like Antarctica slide into the sea, the previously frozen water adds to the volume of the world's oceans, which can lead to sea level rise and potential climate consequences.",
