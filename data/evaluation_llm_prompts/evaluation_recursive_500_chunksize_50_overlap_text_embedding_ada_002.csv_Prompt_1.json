Ice, being white, reflects a significant portion of the sun's rays back into space, which helps to keep the Earth cool. However, when ice melts, it reveals the darker surfaces beneath, such as the sea or land. These darker surfaces absorb more of the sun's rays, converting them into heat and causing the Earth to warm up. This in turn leads to more ice melting, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates global warming. Additionally, certain types of algae that grow on ice can increase the rate of ice melt, further contributing to global warming.",
