      "Energean has taken final investment decision (FID) on its Karish North gas development, offshore Israel. The company forecast the development would start in the second half of 2023. Energean has also announced the signing of a $ 700 million loan, of which $ 150mn will go on Karish North. The company discovered Karish North 21 months ago. The find will be tied back to the Energean Power floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which is 5.4 km away. DeGolyer and MacNaughton provided a report in November 2020 giving 2P reserves at Karish North of 32 billion cubic metres of gas and 34 million barrels of liquids. The first well should produce around 3 bcm per year. The main Karish development is due to begin producing in the fourth quarter of 2021. Subsea and onshore work is due to be completed in the second quarter, while the FPSO should leave Singapore in the third quarter. Adding Karish North to the FPSO will mean that potential flow is more than the vessel s 8 bcm per year capacity, improving project reliability. Energean also announced the signing of an 18-month, $ 700 million loan with JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding. This cash will go to developing the Karish North plan and funding the acquisition of a stake in its Israeli subsidiary. The loan is priced at 5.75%, with 0.25% increases every three months, taking it to a maximum of 7%. The company signed the loan on January 13. At the same time, it reached a deal with lenders for its existing project finance facility. This agreement extends the maturity of the project finance by nine months, to September 2022. Energean will also use cash from the loan to install a second oil train and second riser on the FPSO. This will bring its liquids handling capacity to 40,000 barrels per day, from 21,000 bpd. It also increases the gas-handling capacity to 8 bcm per year, from 6.5 bcm per year. This equipment will be operational in 2022. The company also noted its exploration and appraisal drilling programme in Israel in early 2022, which may include five wells. Energean said the loan and existing facility would allow it to optimise its long-term capital structure.\n"

      "Clearway Energy Group, an owner and operator of renewable assets, has completed construction and reached commercial operations on the 192 MW Rosamond Central solar project in Kern County, Calif. Rosamond Central is contracted under power purchase agreements with East Bay Community Energy and Clean Power Alliance, both community choice aggregators providing a diverse range of power options to regional customers, and the City of Palo Alto Utilities, which has administered Palo Alto s electric power system for 120 years. We are proud to continue contributing to California s goal of 100% clean electricity and keep the state on the forefront of climate leadership, said Valerie Wooley, vice president of origination at Clearway Energy Group. Rosamond Central came together thanks to the dedication and effort of many partners, including McCarthy s swift action to create a safe working environment, and the trust of East Bay Community Energy, Clean Power Alliance and Palo Alto to meet their customers demand for low-cost renewable energy. Construction of Rosamond Central began in February 2020 and was led by McCarthy Building Companies. More than 600 jobs were created during construction and the site will sustain several permanent operations and maintenance jobs. The solar site also represents a $ 5 million investment in Kern County through tax revenue to support area public services. Rosamond Central will expand Clearway s footprint in Kern County, where the company owns and operates 1,053 MW of wind and solar energy assets and contributes approximately $ 20,000,000 in annual property taxes to the local economy.\n"

      "'A groundbreaking achievement in solar energy research has been unveiled as scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Research ISE and NWO Institute AMOLF (Amsterdam) jointly created a multijunction solar cell with an unprecedented efficiency rate of 36.1%. This remarkable milestone marks the highest efficiency ever achieved for a solar cell based on silicon. The team presented their groundbreaking achievement at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference (EU PVSEC) held in Lisbon on September 21, 2023. The research project received funding through the Fraunhofer ICON program. Albert Polman, who spearheaded the AMOLF segment of the project, highlighted the unique collaboration between Fraunhofer ISE and AMOLF, which began in 2020. Fraunhofer ISE is renowned for its work on ultra high efficiency solar cells using silicon and III V semiconductors, while AMOLF has extensive expertise in optimizing light management within solar cells. This collaboration allowed them to achieve an efficiency record that was previously unimaginable. Frank Dimroth from Fraunhofer ISE emphasized that the breakthrough was a result of combining the best processes available from both teams. Their achievement overcame the fundamental limitation of photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency in silicon based solar cells, which was capped at 29.4%. This limitation was surpassed by creating a multijunction solar cell, which involves stacking multiple light absorbing layers to efficiently harness various parts of the sunlight's color spectrum. The record breaking solar cell combines a cutting edge silicon TOPCon solar cell with innovative high efficiency cell designs developed at Fraunhofer ISE. It also incorporates two semiconductor layers made of gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and Gallium Indium Arsenide Phosphide (GaInAsP), both developed at Fraunhofer ISE. Additionally, a specially designed metal/polymer nanocoating crafted at AMOLF and Fraunhofer ISE enhances light trapping within the cell, pushing the efficiency beyond 36%. While these ultra high efficiency solar cells are currently more costly to manufacture than conventional silicon solar cells (which typically achieve up to 27% efficiency), their exceptional performance makes them highly attractive for applications where space is limited, such as solar powered electric cars, consumer products, and drones. Moreover, the novel light management design has broader applications, including silicon perovskite multijunction solar cells, promising a brighter future for renewable energy technologies.\n"

      "'For our 13th Annual Event Indo Renergy 2023 Expo & Forum, we will be bringing together businesses, sustainable energy industry trade associations, government agencies, and energy policy research organizations to showcase the status and near term potential of the cross section of renewable energy (bio fuels/biomass, geothermal, solar, water, wind) and energy efficiency technologies. Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off grid) energy services. Based on REN21's 2016 report, renewables contributed 19.2% to humans'global energy consumption and 23.7% to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% hydro electricity and 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US $ 286 billion in 2015, with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer. As of 2015 worldwide, more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable. (Source: wikipedia.org) Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper. Their share of total energy consumption is increasing. Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas. Indo Renergy 2023, co located with Indo Water, Indo Waste, Indonesia International Smart City, Indo Security, and Indo Firex Expo & Forum, is the region's leading event dedicated to the renewable and alternative energy industries. No where else gives you the opportunity to reach and meet 8,000 industry professionals in one place at the same time and network with key industry buyers and influences.

       "\"['This is the first installment of a three-part series on community solar for low- and moderate-income costumers. The next piece will focus on how partnerships with community-based organizations can catalyze low- and moderate-income solar, while the third will explore the role local governments can play in accelerating solar adoption in those communities.', 'Residential clean energy projects are typically associated with affluent customers. Community solar, however, offers a pathway for low- and moderate-income customers to benefit from clean energy projects too.', 'Residential rooftop solar projects often only benefit the households who live under the array — but community solar projects can reach beyond the property where a project is located, impacting many more customers who otherwise might have a hard time accessing renewable power.', 'Here, we explain how community solar works and how it can deliver benefits for low- and moderate-income customers where projects are sited and beyond.', 'Community solar are solar projects where financial benefits flow to multiple customers within a specific area. The way customers participate in community solar often takes the form of a subscription. Customers voluntarily “ subscribe ” to a project — such as a solar array located in a nearby town that provides power to the local utility — and in turn, receive electricity bill credits based on their subscription. Community solar projects can be led by private businesses, by utilities, and in some cases, communities band together to develop projects themselves.', 'At its core, community solar amounts to a virtual accounting instrument. Unlike residential rooftop solar installations, community solar customers may never see the project they subscribe to or receive electrons generated from it. Community solar developers often outsource subscriber acquisition and subscription management to third-party servicers, so customers may not actually interface with the project owner. And community solar subscribers will not be able to legitimately claim they use solar power if they do not receive the Renewable Energy Certificates ( RECs), transactable commodities representing the renewable attributes associated with the community solar project’ s power generation. RECs from community solar projects are often sold to third parties to help finance the project, so subscribers do not retain the right to tout their use of solar power.', 'Community solar ( CS) can offer financial advantages and flexibility for customers that onsite renewable energy projects may not be readily able to achieve. These advantages of these projects can enable low- and moderate-income customers to participate in solar energy projects where rooftop solar would otherwise be out of reach.', 'The average residential CS subscription in the U.S. is approximately 3 kW in size, saving residential customers about 10% in electricity costs over the life of the subscription. Even these modest electricity bill savings from community solar subscriptions can go a long way for low- and moderate-income customers, who often face staggering energy bills compared to their income. U.S. households at or below twice the federal poverty level spend 3.5 times more of their income on energy costs ( 8.1%) compared to the median other households spend ( 2.3%).', 'Beyond the savings it can bring to low and moderate-income subscribers, community solar can also offer a broad array of services to under-resourced and frontline communities. These services include:', 'The cumulative installed capacity of U.S. community solar has grown dramatically in the last decade, more than doubling on average annually since 2010. At the end of 2021, there were at least 5,219 MW of installed CS capacity in the U.S., with active projects in 40 states and the District of Columbia. Approximately 1,813 MW of community-owned solar was deployed in the United States in 2021 alone, enough to power about 344,470 homes.', 'The size of community solar projects has increased over time too. The southern United States, a region not traditionally known for solar deployment, now boasts some of the largest community solar projects in the country.', 'And the market expansion shows no signs of halting. Although community solar currently represents less than 4% of all installed solar capacity in the United States, the energy market research consultancy Wood Mackenzie projects that the country will add 4.5 gigawatts of community solar capacity over the next five years. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a target of powering five million households with community solar by 2025, an increase in community solar deployment of more than 700% over the next four years.', 'The low- and moderate-income community solar market, in particular, promises massive growth. As of early 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy tallied at least 32.3 MW of low- and moderate-income community solar in operation with seven times that amount in the pipeline for development. In 2022, the renewable energy developer Invenergy and the investment firm Lafayette Square announced a joint venture called Reactivate focused on community solar development for under-resourced communities. Reactivate alone aims to develop 3,000 MW of solar capacity by 2030, serving up to 2.25 million homes.', 'While well-designed community solar programs can deliver important benefits to low- and moderate-income customers and the low- and moderate-income market is growing in the United States, it needs additional support to reach its market potential. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), low- and moderate-income households make up approximately 43% of all U.S. households, but only a tiny fraction are currently being served by community solar. Most of the CS capacity in the United States is served by “ anchor tenants, ” large subscribers that are often commercial entities rather than residential customers.', 'The disconnect between community solar’ s existing reach and its potential may partly be because most current CS offerings are not designed for low- and moderate-income customers. Some CS programs ask consumers to pay a premium for their subscriptions. These programs are designed for customers who can afford to sacrifice financially to support renewable energy, but they are typically out of reach for low- and moderate-income customers.', 'Even programs that provide customer savings may not be appropriate for low- and moderate-income customers if subscriptions come with sharp risks. For example, subscriptions that carry penalties or fees associated with contract termination will not be suitable for low- and moderate-income customers who rent and may need to relocate during the term of their subscription. Even small risks can outweigh the savings benefits for low- and moderate-income consumers, since they have less financial cushion to absorb any unexpected losses.', 'Many subscriptions ask for payment upfront. NREL calculates that about 46% of community solar projects employ upfront payment subscription models, while another 21% have subscriptions with combined upfront and monthly payments, which can make understanding and calculating the subscription value particularly challenging. Low- and moderate-income customers often simply do not have the means for an upfront financial investment, no matter the long-term savings these subscriptions may promise.', 'Without strong incentives and policy support, even well-meaning solar providers may be slow to market to low- and moderate-income customers. Acquisition costs are higher for subscribing low- and moderate-income customers than for their higher-income counterparts. There are several reasons for this, including:', 'To effectively reach low- and moderate-income customers, establishing a community solar program by itself is not enough. To enable meaningful low- and moderate-income customer participation, solar programs must include incentives and special outreach strategies.', 'Many states are catching on. Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C. now have community solar programs with low- and moderate-income customer-specific provisions.', 'These provisions generally either mandate or incentivize low-and moderate-income participation, such as setting minimum levels of low- and moderate-income subscribers on a project or program basis, or subsidizing subscriptions. States with low- and moderate-income solar mandates include Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada and Oregon. States with low- and moderate-income solar incentives subsidize low- and moderate-income subscriptions. States with such incentives include California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.', 'Even in places with established low- and moderate-income community solar programs, reaching those customers can be challenging. Community-based organizations can be instrumental partners for solar engagement. Take UPROSE, a multi-racial, women-led community organization in Brooklyn, New York, that has helped develop a cooperatively-owned CS project on the roof of the Brooklyn Army Terminal. The project promises to deliver bill savings to about 200 households in the neighborhood, where over 30% of residents live below the poverty line. UPROSE breathed life into the project through local meetings, door-to-door outreach, and disseminating informational materials in multiple languages.', 'Education and community outreach are especially important because community solar can be confusing. It involves complex ownership structures with multiple parties, and different subscription and payment configurations. The value proposition of subscriptions can vary dramatically across programs. Even the term “ community solar ” can be confusing because under many programs, a project does not need to be sited in the same community as those who subscribe to it. ( Many programs allow projects to be located anywhere within the same utility service territory as its subscribers.)', 'More than half of U.S. states have not enacted state policies to enable or establish community solar programs. In the absence of state-level enabling legislation, some utilities are launching community solar programs on their own. In Florida, Duke Energy and Florida Power & Light have both created utility-led community solar programs with provisions to ensure savings for participating low-income customers on an ongoing basis.', 'Supported by the Leon Lowenstein Foundation, WRI is working to expand utility-led community solar programs in targeted geographies to ensure they benefit low- and moderate-income customers. For example, in Kentucky, WRI advanced a partnership between electric utilities, Kentucky Habitat for Humanity and a philanthropic organization to pilot a solar subscription gifting program for low-income Kentuckians. Under the program, Kentucky Habitat for Humanity leverages philanthropic donations to purchase subscriptions on behalf of low-income customers, who receive credit on their electric utility bills associated with their subscriptions. The pilot has already lowered grid emissions and reduced the electricity bills of participating low-income households by an average of $ 27.94 a month and will continue to do so over the decades-long life of the project.', 'Community solar offers tremendous promise for providing low- and moderate-income customers with much-needed electricity bill savings, but reaching these customers will require focused policy support, deliberate program design and engagement. States, cities, utilities, community organizations, nonprofits, solar developers and financial institutions all have roles to play to ensure that solar benefits low- and moderate-income customers. After all, many hands make light work.', 'Originally published on WRI’ s Resource Institute.
