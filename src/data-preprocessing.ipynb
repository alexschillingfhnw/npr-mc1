US Southwest Airlines will take-or-pay for 219 million gallons of carbon-negative SAF — generating 575 million gallons of carbon neutral blended SAF — over 15 years. Europe’ s IAG will take 73 million gallons of carbon negative SAF — 192 million gallons of carbon-neutral SAF after blending — over 10 years. Velocys said the deal with IAG was worth $ 800 million. Both deals include a price support mechanism for the greenhouse gas credits associated with Bayou’ s SAF production, which claims a carbon reduction of 6.5 million tons over the term of the contract. The plant has negative lifecycle emissions thanks to its biogenic waste feedstock, renewable power and carbon capture and storage. “ This long-dated offtake, encompassing support for environmental credits, will provide certainty of revenue for the project, which should enable construction capital financing, ” Velocys CEO Henrik Wareborn said about both deals. “ This agreement shows that commercial-scale demand for SAF can be satisfied already by the middle of this decade and that Velocys plays a pivotal role in enabling this, ” he added.']\""
