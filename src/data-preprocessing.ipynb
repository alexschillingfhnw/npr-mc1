    "Effective text preprocessing is a critical step in preparing our data for further analysis, as it directly impacts the quality and accuracy of the results we can achieve. After conducting an initial exploration of the dataset, we identified several areas that require attention to ensure our text data is clean, consistent and usable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing in this case involves handling various nuances that are common in unstructured textual data, such as URLs, special characters and abbreviations. Each preprocessing decision must strike a balance between cleaning the data and preserving key information that could affect the integrity of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following steps outline our approach to cleaning the text data:**\n",
    "- Converting all text to lowercase ensures uniformity and reduces redundancy, as \"Carbon\" and \"carbon\" would be treated as the same word.\n",
    "- Removing URLs, because they dont provide meaningful insight.\n",
    "- Special characters (for example \", !, ?, ', ` etc.) can introduce noise if not handled carefully. However, not all punctuation marks should be removed entirely. For example, percentages (like \"0.2%\") or numerical ranges (\"2.2 million\") contain important information that must be preserved - if we delete these punctuations the information in the text would not be factually correct anymore (\"2.2 million\" would turn into 22 million).\n",
    "- The handling of symbols like `/` and `-` also requires nuance. A forward slash (`/`) used in phrases such as \"tons/yr\" should be replaced with \"per,\" while hyphens connecting words (for example \"carbon-negative\") should be replaced with spaces rather than being removed, to retain the meaning of compound terms. Hyphens surrounded by spaces, on the other hand, can be safely removed as they often act as separators rather than meaningful connectors.\n",
    "- Finally, careful consideration needs to be given to country abbreviations that could be misinterpreted as common words (for example \"US\" and \"us\"). Ensuring context-driven handling of these abbreviations is necessary to avoid misclassification or distortion of the data."
