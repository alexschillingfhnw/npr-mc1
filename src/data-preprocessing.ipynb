       "\"['Velocys has signed two offtake agreements that cover the entire sustainable aviation fuel ( SAF) production from its Bayou Fuels plant in Mississippi for at least ten years from start up in 2026. US Southwest Airlines will take-or-pay for 219 million gallons of carbon-negative SAF — generating 575 million gallons of carbon neutral blended SAF — over 15 years. Europe’ s IAG will take 73 million gallons of carbon negative SAF — 192 million gallons of carbon-neutral SAF after blending — over 10 years. Velocys said the deal with IAG was worth $ 800 million. Both deals include a price support mechanism for the greenhouse gas credits associated with Bayou’ s SAF production, which claims a carbon reduction of 6.5 million tons over the term of the contract. The plant has negative lifecycle emissions thanks to its biogenic waste feedstock, renewable power and carbon capture and storage. “ This long-dated offtake, encompassing support for environmental credits, will provide certainty of revenue for the project, which should enable construction capital financing, ” Velocys CEO Henrik Wareborn said about both deals. “ This agreement shows that commercial-scale demand for SAF can be satisfied already by the middle of this decade and that Velocys plays a pivotal role in enabling this, ” he added.']\""

    "Effective text preprocessing is a critical step in preparing our data for further analysis, as it directly impacts the quality and accuracy of the results we can achieve. After conducting an initial exploration of the dataset, we identified several areas that require attention to ensure our text data is clean, consistent and usable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing in this case involves handling various nuances that are common in unstructured textual data, such as URLs, special characters and abbreviations. Each preprocessing decision must strike a balance between cleaning the data and preserving key information that could affect the integrity of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following steps outline our approach to cleaning the text data:**\n",
    "- Converting all text to lowercase ensures uniformity and reduces redundancy, as \"Carbon\" and \"carbon\" would be treated as the same word.\n",
    "- Removing URLs, because they dont provide meaningful insight.\n",
    "- Special characters (for example \", !, ?, ', ` etc.) can introduce noise if not handled carefully. However, not all punctuation marks should be removed entirely. For example, percentages (like \"0.2%\") or numerical ranges (\"2.2 million\") contain important information that must be preserved - if we delete these punctuations the information in the text would not be factually correct anymore (\"2.2 million\" would turn into 22 million).\n",
    "- The handling of symbols like `/` and `-` also requires nuance. A forward slash (`/`) used in phrases such as \"tons/yr\" should be replaced with \"per,\" while hyphens connecting words (for example \"carbon-negative\") should be replaced with spaces rather than being removed, to retain the meaning of compound terms. Hyphens surrounded by spaces, on the other hand, can be safely removed as they often act as separators rather than meaningful connectors.\n",
    "- Finally, careful consideration needs to be given to country abbreviations that could be misinterpreted as common words (for example \"US\" and \"us\"). Ensuring context-driven handling of these abbreviations is necessary to avoid misclassification or distortion of the data."

       "'[\"• Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd. ( NPCIL) synchronized Kakrapar-3 in the western state of Gujarat to the grid on Jan. 10, making it the first of India\\'s 700 megawatt indigenously developed pressurized heavy water reactors ( PHWRs) to reach this milestone ( NIW Sep.18\\'20). The news was tweeted by Anil Kakodkar, former chairman of the Department of Atomic Energy, who said that 15 more units of the same design will follow. Three of these are currently under construction -- another at Kakrapar, and two at NPCIL\\'s Rajasthan plant. They will be followed by two at the greenfield Gorakhpur site in Haryana, and then a planned 10-unit fleet at Gorakhpur and three other sites. Kakrapar-3 was five years past its 2015 completion date, achieving criticality in July 2020, 10 years after construction began. Commercial operations are slated to begin in March, according to NPCIL\\'s website, although that deadline will likely not be met. India\\'s nuclear suppliers should be feeling some relief over Kakrapar-3\\'s start-up, although order flows will depend on how quickly NPCIL can get other projects moving, and the course of the Covid-19 pandemic ( NIW Dec.11\\'20). • The inaugural US small modular reactor ( SMR) project has moved into its second phase with Fluor and its NuScale subsidiary announcing Jan. 11 that per agreements with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems ( Uamps) they `` are to develop higher maturity cost estimates and initial project planning work for the licensing, manufacturing and construction of the CFPP [ Carbon Free Power Project ]. \\'\\' However, Uamps confirmed to Energy Intelligence that committed offtake now stands at just 100 MW for what was planned as a 750 MW, 12-module SMR plant. With NuScale providing additional options for `` plant size configuration, Uamps could decide to build a plant ranging from 4 modules ( 308 megawatts) to 12 modules ( 924 megawatts), \\'\\' a Uamps spokesman wrote in an email. In early 2019 Uamps boasted offtake commitments of 230 MW. But that included US Department of Energy ( DOE) plans to take output from up to two 60 MW modules. Those plans ended last year with the DOE instead offering $ 1.35 billion in multiyear funding for the project. Eight Uamps subscribers dropped out of the project and another two offtakers substantially reduced their commitments. • Across the ocean NuScale has launched a play for the UK market via a memorandum of understanding with start-up clean energy firm Shearwater Energy to explore the deployment of hybrid SMR and wind energy projects across the country. The companies are hoping to score a flagship site at or near the Wylfa plant in north Wales, where last year Hitachi decided to wind down its advanced boiling water reactor ( ABWR) project development company ( NIW Sep.18\\'20). A Wylfa SMR-wind plant `` will provide 3 GW of reliable, zero-carbon electricity at a fraction of the cost of a conventional nuclear power station with surplus energy generation focused on the production of hydrogen to support the transport sector’ s transition to low-carbon fuels, \\'\\' Shearwater CEO Simon Forster said in a Jan. 12 statement. But Shearwater was only incorporated in 2018, and any way forward for the project is likely to depend on suitably attractive economics, a UK government nuclear subsidy regime, plus locking in a site that may be grabbed by another interested consortium first ( related).\"]'"
